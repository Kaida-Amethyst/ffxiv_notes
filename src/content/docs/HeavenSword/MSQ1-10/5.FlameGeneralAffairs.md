-- Alphinaud wishes to share his plan of action for rescuing Raubahn.

Tataru

-- Gods, I hope we're not too late to save General Raubahn... I should have told you sooner─about the execution, I mean─but what with the trial and everything... <sigh>

Alphinaud

-- Though the situation calls for urgency, it would avail us little to charge headlong into Ul'dah without a plan. Before we can formulate a plan, however, we must first learn how things stand in the sultanate--which is why I propose that we visit Limsa Lominsa.

-- Aye, you heard me right. While you were about your altruistic endeavors, I acted as an intermediary in trade negotiations between House Fortemps and a Lominsan consortium. During said negotiations, an opportunity to send word to the Admiral presented itself, and I duly seized it.

-- I am happy to report that we yet have a stout ally in Limsa. The Admiral has pledged her full cooperation in any effort to rescue Raubahn.

-- Accordingly, I have agreed to meet with her, that we might discuss how best to proceed. Naturally, I told her to expect us both. Your presence never fails to embolden our allies, after all.

-- When you arrive in Limsa Lominsa, make yourself known to Sergeant Zanthael at Bulwark Hall on the lower decks. He will admit you to the Bridge.

-----------------------------

Alphinaud

-- Speak with Sergeant Zanthael when you are ready to meet the Admiral. He will admit us to the Bridge.

Zanthael

-- The Admiral has been expecting you. Say the word and I will take you to her.

Merlwyb

-- Friends. 'Tis good to see you safe and well. I will admit, I had not counted on you seeking─let alone finding─refuge within the Holy See, but full glad was I to learn that you had.

Alphinaud

-- Thankfully, we had allies there who took us under their wing. And theirs was not the only aid we received, I suspect. When we fled Ul'dah, we fully expected to become wanted men, known to all and hounded at every turn. Yet that did not come to pass. On the contrary, 'twould seem the charges against us have not been made public. Might we have you to thank for that, Admiral?

Merlwyb

-- Sharp as ever, Master Alphinaud. On Marshal Tarupin's urging, the Elder Seedseer and I demanded that the Syndicate suppress news of the Scions' alleged crimes until such time as irrefutable evidence could be found. Our argument was simple: lacking proof, to accuse the saviors of the realm of so unlikely a crime would have the people up in arms. In their wisdom, the Syndicate agreed, as you yourself have seen.

-- There is something you should know. Some few days prior to the banquet, the Elder Seedseer and I were summoned for a private audience with the sultana. There, she revealed her intent to announce her abdication, that she might pave the way for the establishment of an Ul'dahn republic.

Alphinaud

-- What? But such an announcement would have plunged the entire nation into chaos!

Merlwyb

-- She was well aware of that. 'Twas for fear of what might ensue that she summoned us. Her Grace wanted the Elder Seedseer and I to lend Raubahn a helping hand, you see─to aid him in preserving the peace during the transition.

Alphinaud

-- So...having somehow caught wind of her plan, Lolorito and Teledji plotted the sultana's assassination in the hope of maintaining the constitutional status quo...? But they must have known that her death would sow as much chaos as her abdication─chaos from which Teledji alone might feasibly stand to profit. Surely Lolorito would never knowingly─Ah. Could it be...? I dare not hope...

Eynzahr Slafyrsyn

-- The Ul'dahn authorities have yet to announce the sultana's passing. To allay any suspicion that may arise from Her Grace's absence, they have issued a statement to the effect that she is presently convalescing from illness.

Merlwyb

-- Mayhap they're waiting for a fitting moment to break the news. Or mayhap they know of some other reason to delay.

Alphinaud

-- Something else has been bothering me, Admiral. I was dismayed to learn that General Raubahn is to be executed--yet upon hearing the news, I could not help but wonder why he had been kept alive for so long. Pray mistake not my meaning--I am, of course, overjoyed that our friend still draws breath, and that he might yet be saved. But if his enemies truly wished to eliminate him, they could have done so immediately. I see no reason for this delay.

Merlwyb

-- Aye... You've struck upon an important point, Master Alphinaud. Following his capture, Raubahn had been held in the Marasaja Pit within Ul'dah. In recent days, however, he has reportedly been moved to an unknown location. Queerly, 'twas not the Brass Blades who spirited him away, either, but a band of soldiers decked in blue...

Alphinaud

-- The Crystal Braves.

Merlwyb

-- Aye. If I read the winds aright, the arrangement between Lord Lolorito and the Braves has come under strain.

-- At any rate, if we're to rescue Raubahn, we'll have to find him first. And you'll be glad to hear that I have already entrusted the task to those best able to see it done--our friends of Doma.

Merlwyb

-- Raubahn's survival is vital to the Eorzean Alliance. We can ill afford to lose him. But I cannot send troops into Ul'dah. 'Twould spell the end of the Alliance, and war, like as not. If there is to be a rescue, it falls to you and yours to attempt it.

Alphinaud

-- I would not have it any other way, Admiral. It was I who founded the Crystal Braves, and I who must take responsibility for their actions.

Merlwyb

-- Spoken like a true leader, Master Alphinaud. By way of a first step, you should seek out our Doman contact. You will find her among the frontier hands at Revenant's Toll, working in a kitchen.

Alphinaud

-- The Crystal Braves may no longer answer to me, but that does not absolve me of responsibility. As commander, I am accountable for all the wrongs they have committed--all the havoc they have wreaked.

Merlwyb

-- Though it's useless to dwell on the past, I often wonder if I could have--and should have--done more for you and Raubahn that day. Leaving the banquet was tantamount to leaving you and yours for dead. Should you think me craven, I wouldn't hold it against you. But I will make it up to you, this I swear. Come what may, know that the Scions of the Seventh Dawn can count on our cooperation.

Eynzahr Slafyrsyn

-- Would that we could join you in rescuing the Flame General, but the sultanate would not take kindly to a foreign power on their soil, allies or no.

Higiri

-- Mistress Kali! I knew in my heart that you were safe, but to see you again in the flesh... Words cannot well express my relief. Even as the victory feast was taking place, the Crystal Braves turned upon us and took the Rising Stones by force. Amid the chaos, some few of my compatriots and I were able to slip away unnoticed. Since then, we have remained in Revenant's Toll, keeping watch over the mutineers while awaiting your return. You have done well by us, and we Domans do not soon forget our debts. We swear to do all within our power to aid you.

Alphinaud reveals that he has been in contact with Merlwyb, who remains a stout ally to the Scions. Wishing to know how things stand in the sultanate prior to any rescue attempt, he has arranged to meet with the Admiral, and bids you join him. Make your way to Bulwark Hall on Limsa Lominsa's lower decks and speak with Storm Sergeant Zanthael to be admitted to the Bridge.

Merlwyb informs you that Raubahn has been moved to an unknown location ahead of his impending execution─by none other than the Crystal Braves. Since word of this troubling development arrived, the shinobi of Doma have been frantically gathering intelligence on the Flame General's whereabouts, and the Admiral bids you seek out her Doman contact, a female frontier hand currently working in a kitchen at Revenant's Toll.

The Doman contact is revealed to be Higiri. During the ill-fated victory feast, members of the Crystal Braves seized the Rising Stones by force, but she and a number of her compatriots were able to escape. Grateful for the kindness the Scions showed to them, the Domans stand ready to aid in Raubahn's rescue.

# In Search of Raubahn

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Higiri is eager to assit you.

Higiri

-- Shortly before you arrived, I received word from Limsa Lominsa that you were searching for General Raubahn. As the Admiral will have informed you, he was recently moved from his cell in the Marasaja Pit. At the same juncture, Yuyuhase and the 3rd Unit were observed leaving the Rising Stones. This can be no simple coincidence. Their purpose, we believe, is to escort the Flame General to the scene of his execution. Suffice it to say, we have people shadowing the 3rd. If you would join the hunt, pray seek out Doware at Highbridge, where I too am bound.

-- My comrades pursue the 3rd Unit Braves, even as we speak. If you would join the hunt, pray seek out Doware at Highbridge, where I too am bound.

Alphinaud

-- Yet again, our Doman friends prove their worth... Lolorito was a fool to refuse them asylum.

```plaintext
Alphinaud

-- Yuyuhase... The mere mention of the name calls to mind the moment I felt the kiss of cold steel against my neck...

Higiri

-- It has been a while since last I wore this garb. Since I came to Revenant's Toll, my days have been spent in kitchens. Fear not, however: though I have learned to wield a skillet, I have not forgotten the use of a dagger.

Doware

-- I have been expecting you. Time is of the essence, so I shall be direct. Yuyuhase and his men are bound for Halatali. We believe that this is where they intend to carry out the execution. Hozan is presently keeping watch over the entrance. Let us make haste and join him.

Alphinaud

-- Raubahn's ties to Halatali are well known. That Ilberd should choose this of all places to stage his execution is no coincidence. The fiend... Are there no depths to which he will not stoop?

Hozan

-- You come at a good time, my friends. But moments ago, the traitor Ilberd arrived and entered Halatali. From this, we may be certain that General Raubahn is being held within.

Higiri informs you that the 3rd Unit Braves, led by Yuyuhase, have recently left the Rising Stones. Their purpose: to escort Raubahn to his execution. Make your way to Highbridge and seek out Doware, who will apprise you of the unit's movements.

According to Doware, Yuyuhase and the 3rd are bound for Halatali. Make your way to the training grounds in eastern Thanalan, and join Hozan at the entrance.

Hozan informs you that Ilberd was seen entering Halatali mere moments before your arrival--proof positive that Raubahn is being held within.

Alphinaud

Yugiri

-- Master Alphinaud. I am pleased to see that the light of resolve shines in your eyes once more.

Alphinaud

-- Ah, yes... How pathetic I must have seemed to you when we last met. I am ashamed to recall it. For a time I was well and truly lost. But with the aid of my comrades, I have since refound my purpose, and I shall take care not to misplace it again.

Yugiri

-- Since your escape from Ul'dah, my fellow shinobi and I have shadowed the Crystal Braves' every step in hopes of learning the Scions' whereabouts. Regrettably, our investigation has yet to yield any useful information. Pray forgive us.

Alphinaud

-- You need not apologize, my lady--we are grateful for all that you have done on our behalf. Besides, Raubahn is no less a friend, and we cannot well abandon him to his fate.

Yugiri

-- Hozan--the three of us shall attend to the Flame General's rescue. Pray draw away the guards by the entrance. Take Doware and Higiri with you.

Yugiri

Alphinaud

Yugiri

-- Nevertheless, we must quit this place.

Ilberd

Alphinaud

Ilberd

-- You mean to struggle on, then? Very well. If you would stand in my way, I will cut you down like all the rest. Come, Scions--let's get this over with.

Ilberd

-- This changes nothing..

Alphinaud

-- It is over, Ilberd! Lay down your arms and surrender yourself to justice!

Ilberd

-- Justice!? Justice for what exactly? 'Twas not I who assassinated the sultana, boy!

Alphinaud

-- Ere we debate who is responsible for the assassination, I would ask whether an assassination took place at all.

Ilberd

-- Clever little shite...

-- If you think you fight for justice, lass, you'd best wake up. The truth is, you fight for whoever bloody well tells you to. Can you not see you're being used!? By the Scions, the city–states, even the Crystal Braves. They none of 'em care a whit what you want--only what you can do for them.

-- And how do I know this? Because I'm the same--a pawn to be used as my masters see fit. All I ever wanted was to liberate my homeland, and I ate dirt to make it happen. But what have I achieved after all these years in servitude? Nothing! Not a bloody thing.

-- If we ourselves are not free--free to think and to act--how are we ever to reclaim our homeland? Know this: there is nothing I would not give to take back Ala Mhigo! NOTHING!

Alphinaud

-- You'll not get away!

Yugiri

Raubahn

-- I'm but a cripple and a fool, and still you came for me... I'm in your debt.

Alphinaud

-- We are all of us fools of fate, General. But even fools have a part to play.

Me

-- On your feet, gladiator. This fight is not over.

Raubahn

-- Rest assured, I was not planning to die till I'd avenged the sultana... Still your words are welcome, lass.

-- Know this, Ilberd... There is nothing I would not give to see you pay for what you've done. My wealth, my arm, my life...nothing.

Alphinaud

-- General--are you aware that Lord Lolorito has yet to announce the sultana's death to the public?

Raubahn

-- ...What? No. No, I was not aware of that--nor of anything else outside my cell. 'Tis passing strange, though... I assumed the bastard would make it known at the first opportunity and set about tearing down the sultanate.

Alphinaud

-- As did we all. And it is indeed strange that he did not--strange or perhaps revealing? Now, I have no conclusive proof, nor do I wish to give you false hope...but I have reason to believe that Her Grace may yet live.

Raubahn

-- What? But how can that be?

Yugiri

-- Forgive me, friends, but it is not safe here. Let us continue this conversation without.

Yugiri

Doware

-- My lady. The guards have been subdued, as per your command. We have since kept watch over the entrance. There has been no further activity.

Yugiri

-- Then Ilberd and his minions have fled via some other egress. Scour the perimeter for signs of their passing.

Doware

-- At once, my lady!

Dark Stranger

-- General Aldynn, I presume, and the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.

Alphinaud

-- Who are you!? Identify yourself!

Dark Stranger

-- Pray do not be alarmed. My mistress is a friend, and I come bearing a message of goodwill. For your own safety, she bade me direct your steps to the Waking Sands. Know that Master Urianger awaits you there, along with others sympathetic to your cause. This is no ruse, I assure you. General Aldynn--if you will come with me, I have prepared a carriage, that you may travel in comfort, safe from prying eyes.

Alphinaud

-- I have spoken with Urianger via linkpearl. He confirms the man's story. Raubahn is in safe hands. Let us make our own way to Vesper Bay.

Urianger

-- My dearest friends! Praise be unto the Twelve for delivering you from the clutches of treachery.

Pipin

-- Father!

Raubahn

-- Pipin, my son... And Master Papashan besides...

Pipin

-- Forgive me, Father... I should have been at Her Grace's side...

Dewlala

-- Save your tears. The sultana yet lives.

-- It was I who arranged this gathering. And judging by your perplexed expressions, it would seem introductions are in order. I am Dewlala, head of the Order of Nald'thal, and member of the Syndicate.

Raubahn

-- What you said about the sultana--is it true? Is she alive?

Dewlala

-- Young lady--I understand you were with the sultana when she drank from the poisoned goblet and collapsed. Would I be correct in assuming that you did not personally verify Her Grace's vital signs?

Raubahn

-- Why ask, when 'tis plain you know the answer!

Dewlala

-- Calm yourself, General, and let me finish. The truth is not as you imagine it. You are all victims of a most ingenious ruse--a ruse conceived to eliminate the threat posed by Teledji Adeledji. 'Tis my belief that Teledji plotted the sultana's assassination alone, but that Lolorito caught wind of his plot, and exploited it to his own ends. He sought to manipulate you into eliminating Teledji for him, and you duly obliged. At one fell swoop, he removed his two foremost rivals, all the while remaining above suspicion.

Raubahn

-- Gods strike me down for a fool... But the sultana--how can it be that she lives?

Dewlala

-- She lives because Lolorito willed it. Her own lady-in-waiting is but one of his many little birds; by her sleight of hand, the poison was switched for a less deadly draft before it could reach her mistress's lips.

Urianger

-- Some manner of sedative, perchance...of a potency sufficient to induce a slumber like unto death.

Dewlala

-- Were I to guess, I would say Her Grace is being held somewhere, dreaming dreams of a brighter Ul'dah, even as we speak.

Raubahn

-- Oh, Nanamo...I will never forgive Lolorito for his part in this.

Dewlala

-- Though Lolorito's hands are far from clean, they did pluck Her Grace from the jaws of death. That must count for something. And though one may call the man's methods into question, it cannot be denied that he knows the value of stability--to the very gil, like as not. He craves power, 'tis true, but he has no desire to depose the sultana. I had never taken sides in your feud with the Monetarists, but it was not for want of concern for our nation's welfare. Indeed, 'twas out of the desire to see order restored that I furnished your Far Eastern friends with information, and arranged this gathering. 

-- I hope you are ready to work, General, for there is much work to be done. Our first priority must be to bring matters back into balance. Lest you forget Her Grace's words, the true wealth of Ul'dah lies in the health, happiness, and hopes of her people. As for the more worldly kind of wealth, I am content to let Lolorito help himself to whatever Teledji Adeledji left behind. You, meanwhile, must do that which you alone can do: rescue Her Grace and take your place at her side once more. For her sake...and that of our nation.

Alphinaud

-- I had not counted on Prioress Dewlala herself appearing. In my defense, my suspicions regarding the sultana proved more prescient. Much remains to be done, but in rescuing Raubahn, we have taken a vital first step towards resolving matters in Ul'dah. We couldn't have done it without you, Luna. Thank you.

Slafswys

-- I heard ye pulled General Aldynn from the graspin' fingers of Thal Himself. It pains me, it does, to see that proud warrior less an arm...

Radolf

-- It is time for the Scions to strike back! The winds have changed, Warrior of Light, and we must ride this gale as far as it will carry us!

Yugiri

-- My fellow Domans and I are glad to have been of service in the Flame General's rescue. If there is aught else we can do, know that we are ever at your disposal.

Papashan

-- Thank you for rescuing General Raubahn. From the bottom of my heart. To behold him now, gaunt and unkempt... It pains me to think of all the hardship he has endured.

Dewlala

-- If we are to see stability restored to Ul'dah, we must needs set aside our differences. No more can there be Monetarists or Royalists.

Arenvald

-- Thank the gods you're all right. 'Twas a mighty struggle, from what I heard. Would that I could have fought by your side.

Wigstan

-- From the political landscape to our struggles against the beastman, little is certain and less is within our control. We can but focus on those things that we have the power to change.

Raubahn

-- It avails us naught to dwell upon that which we have lost. Nay, we must focus on protecting that which we yet have.

Pipin

-- Father's spirit burns as fiercely as it ever has. I was proud of him when he ruled the bloodsands as the Bull of Ala Mhigo, and I am proud of him now.

Urianger

-- As one age endeth and another doth arise, so do our struggles wax and wane. What wouldst thou ask of me?

-- (How fares the realm?) Words cannot well express my joy for thy safe return. Together, let us see that the light of the Scions doth shine again.

-- (What of the primals?) So another primal hath arisen in the northern lands, one whose might transcendeth all who have gone before. And those that thou didst fell are returned once more, imbued with hithertofore unseen strength by the Paragons. These servants of Darkness continue to sow their dark seeds, to ends none but they know. We must needs remain vigilant. Pray stand ever ready to answer the call to arms, for none but these canst prevail over the beings.

There is no telling when Raubahn may be executed. Make your preparations without delay, and signal your readiness to begin the mission to the waiting Hozan.

With the aid of Alphinaud and Yugiri, you have succeeded in rescuing Raubahn from the clutches of the traitorous Crystal Braves. Make your way back outside to eastern Thanalan.

You emerge in the hot desert air. Speak with Doware, who awaits your return.

Outside Halatali, you are approached by a messenger, who claims that his mistress is sympathetic to your cause. For your own safety, he bids you make your way to the Waking Sands. Speak with Alphinaud to learn what he thinks of this mysterious invitation.

Alphinaud is sufficiently convinced that the messenger and his mistress can be trusted. Do as bade and make your way to western Thanalan, where your old haunt the Waking Sands still stands.

Upon arriving at the Waking Sands, you are greeted by a number of familiar faces--Urianger, Pipin, and Papashan. Soon after, it is revealed that the messenger's mistress is no less an individual than Dewlala, head of the Order of Nald'thal and member of the Syndicate. To Raubahn's immense relief, she confirms Alphinaud's suspicion that Nanamo is still alive, and goes on to speculate that the sultana may be confined somewhere in a state of induced slumber. Trouble Alphinaud for his thoughts on these revelations.

Alphinaud thanks you for your part in Raubahn's rescue. With the Flame General safe, your work in Ul'dah is done for now.
