-- When a man like Lord Emmanellain is in high spirits, you can be sure that trouble is in store.

Honoroit

-- Ah, Mistress Kali! Lord Emmanellain would like to speak with you.

Emmanellain

-- Shall we be off then, old girl? Ah, but where are my manners. Emmanellain de Fortemps, second son of Count Edmont de Fortemps─trueborn, that is. Yes, yes─I know what you're thinking, and you are absolutely right. What ill fortune to be born second in a society where the eldest inherits all. Oh, my brother would never cut me off, 'tis true, but who could be satisfied subsisting on a meager allowance, forever overshadowed by his sibling? Not I, old girl, not I!

-- Which is why I need your help to ensure that this business in the Sea of Clouds goes swimmingly, so that the tales of my great deeds can win me a place in the people's hearts─or better yet, raise me higher in their estimations than Artoirel! Ambitious, I grant you, but then I do have a legendary hero to do my bidding! Hah hah hah!

-- Oh, don't look at me that way! I jest, I jest! Anyway, we are to aid the good men and women of House Haillenarte. They have ever been steadfast friends to our house─though they've fallen on hard times since the Calamity, poor blighters. As for what precisely we will be doing, well... What fun would it be if I told you everything in advance? Just come along with me to the airship landing. We'll need to take the airship to Camp Cloudtop.

Honoroit

-- Ah, my lord, there is still the matter of the bill...

Emmanellain

-- Everything has been taken care of, old girl. Simply tell the attendant when you are ready to board, and away we'll go!

Airship Ticketer

-- Are you ready to depart, madam? The airship bound for Camp Cloudtop will be leaving shortly.

Laniaitte

-- Mistress Kali! Welcome! I am Ser Laniaitte de Haillenarte, commander of the forces stationed here at Camp Cloudtop. Strange though it may sound, I have long dreamed of meeting you. I am in your debt, you see, and shall ever remain so. Were it not for you, my younger brother Francel would have been executed upon the word of a false inquisitor.

-- Alas, a knight must go where duty demands, and thus have I been unable to seek you out. But by the grace of Halone, I have been granted an opportunity to thank my brother's savior in person, and to call upon her generous aid besides. Truly, I know not what I have done to deserve this double blessing!

Emmanellain

-- Ahem! 'Tis a pleasure to see you again, my lady Laniaitte! You cut an elegant figure as always─a steel-clad rose, equally at home on a battlefield or in a ballroom.

Laniaitte

-- ...Lord Emmanellain, if it is not too much to ask, I should be grateful if you would allow me to finish speaking with Mistress Kali.

-- Camp Cloudtop was established to provide early warning of impending Dravanian incursions. The high elevation afforded by the floating isles makes it ideal for this purpose. Naturally, it also makes us a ready target for attack. We are not defenseless, however. The Protector, our largest and most advanced airship, is capable of downing all but the mightiest dragons.

-- Alas, as you may have noticed, it is currently undergoing repair. What is worse, our efforts have been hampered by an indigenous beast tribe known as the Vanu Vanu, with whom we have had several skirmishes already.

Emmanellain

-- No beastman is a match for a man of Ishgard! Bring me a birdman and I'll show him a thing or two!

Laniaitte

-- <sigh> I fear much and more may be asked of you in the days to come, Mistress Kali.
```

>> I am in your debt, you see, and shall ever remain so.

Emmanellain de Fortemps, second son of Count Edmont de Fortemps, has long dreamed of emerging from beneath his elder brother's shadow. Though he had always intended to use his mission to aid House Haillenarte to further this aim, he had not counted on having the famed Warrior of Light to assist him. Eager to take advantage of his good fortune, he makes haste for the airship landing and bids you follow.

The attendant informs you that the airship bound for Camp Cloudtop will be departing shortly. Board it and journey to the Sea of Clouds.

After an uneventful flight, you arrive in Camp Cloudtop. Speak with Lord Emmanellain and see what he would have you do next.

After making mock of your loquacious nature, Lord Emmanellain bids you seek out and speak with Lady Laniaitte, the garrison commander in Camp Cloudtop.

After treating you to an unexpectedly warm welcome, Lady Laniaitte explains that she is the elder sister of Lord Francel, whose unjust execution you prevented during your search for the Enterprise long ago. Her gladness at your presence does not extend to Lord Emmanellain, however, though the young lord seems oblivious to her low opinion of him.

# An Indispensable Ally

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Lady Laniaitte knows all too well what must be done to ensure that your time spent in Camp Cloudtop is not for nothing.

Emmanellain

-- Ahhh, my lovely Lady Laniaitte! I shall win your heart yet!

Honoroit

-- My lord, pray do not do anything rash...

Laniaitte

-- While I understand Count Edmont's intentions, I would rather not waste valuable time ensuring that the young lord doesn't get trampled underfoot. True, it is entirely possible that he may learn something from this experience...but if left to his own devices, I think it far more likely that he will make a mess of things. Tell him...tell him that I would like him to keep watch for...Dravanian outflyers. Then, when you have a moment to speak with his manservant in private, make it clear that it is his responsibility to keep Emmanellain from shirking his duty.

-- Remember to stress that this is a task vital to the continued survival of Camp Cloudtop─or something to that effect.

Honoroit

-- I must say, is it me, or is the air here a bit...uhhh...

Emmanellain

-- Hm? A request from Laniaitte? Why didn't she think to ask me in person? Surely she must see me standing here but a few yalms away... Oh, never mind. What is it?

Me

-- (Option 1) A mission of paramount importance: keep watch for Dravanian outflyers.
-- (Option 2) Roam about and keep an eye out for anything unusual.

Emmanellain

-- (In response to 1) A m-mission!? Yes...yes, of course! That is why I am here. I shall do as my lady asks!
-- (In response to 2) Oh, is that all? No “leading the van against a beast tribe stronghold” or some such? Well, it is a rather droll task, but who am I to deny her? I shall begin at once!

Honorit

-- Ah, Mistress Kali. I do not believe I have properly introduced myself. My name is Honoroit, and I serve at the pleasure of Lord Emmanellain. ...Lady Laniaitte would have me accompany Lord Emmanellain on his mission!? Ah, I understand completely. I will do my utmost to keep him out of harm's way.

Laniaitte

-- Were he of another house, mayhap I would not feel obligated to go to such lengths to preserve his safety and dignity...In any case, I appreciate you speaking to him for me. It would seem he actually listens to you─at least, more so than others. Or mayhap you are more skilled at this than most. Aye, I suspect you have had to humor your fair share of difficult men before.

>
> 这里的most指的是大多数人，humor除了幽默的意思之外，还可以表示迁就忍让，fair share字面意思是”公平的份额“，应该理解为“相当量的”，因此，整句话的意思就是：你比大多数人更擅长这个，我感觉你以前应该经常更这些难对付的人打交道。

Left to his own devices, Lord Emmanellain is likely to cause all manner of trouble─this Lady Laniaitte knows from experience. Therefore, your first course of action will be to assign him a duty which will keep him distracted for the duration of your visit. Inform the young noble that he is to keep watch for Dravanian outflyers.

Though disappointed that Lady Laniaitte did not see fit to tell him personally, Lord Emmanellain accepts the orders as well as can be expected. Now that you have privacy, explain to Honoroit, Lord Emmanellain's manservant, that he must ensure that the young lord stays focused on his duty.

Honoroit is astute enough to read between the lines and promises to keep his master out of harm's way. Let Lady Laniaitte know that all has gone according to plan.

Were it not for the close relationship between House Haillenarte and House Fortemps, Lady Laniaitte would not feel obligated to spare Lord Emmanellain's feelings. Clearly, this is not the first time she has had to go to such lengths...and it is almost certainly not the last.

# Meeting the Neighbors

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Lady Laniaitte is eager to get to more important business.

Laniaitte

-- Now that Emmanellain is out of harm's way, we are free to discuss matters of actual import, such as our struggles with the Vanu Vanu. We first encountered the Vanu several years ago, when we had just begun to explore the Sea of Clouds. After an exchange of pleasantries and gifts, we received permission to construct a permanent lookout post. There was peace between our peoples for half a year, until suddenly, for reasons unknown, their attitudes towards us changed. They began to attack our foraging parties without provocation, forcing us to rely more heavily on supplies flown in from Ishgard. 

-- ...But words are no substitute for firsthand experience. Go and see Ser Marielle─she could use your assistance.

-- Rather than listening to me go on and on, I think you would benefit from firsthand experience with the Vanu. Speak with Ser Marielle─she'll be expecting you.

Marielle

-- Mistress Kali, I presume? Lady Laniaitte told me you were coming.I hear tell you've never faced a Vanu before? Well, spend enough time on patrol and you're sure to cross paths with them eventually. These birdmen are native to the floating isles. I say “birdmen,” but they're not at all like the Ixal─unless that Ixal's mother was a gigas. Here, let me mark several locations on your map. If you discover any Vanu in these areas, kill or drive them away.

-- For all I know, you may find nothing. If so, let us consider it an auspicious omen...

System

-- You steel yourself for a mighty struggle, yet find no Vanu lying in wait.

Marielle

-- Finished with your patrol? Anything to report?

-- Heh, maybe it was too much to hope for a day without a skirmish. At least I can take solace in the fact that Halone has blessed us with a mighty ally.

Instead of listening to her expound at greater length, Lady Laniaitte would rather have you gain firsthand experience of the Vanu Vanu. To that end, she sends you to speak with Ser Marielle, who could use your assistance.

Though Ser Marielle describes the Vanu as birdmen, she is quick to clarify that they are nothing like the Ixal. She marks several locations on your map and bids you stand watch in case the Vanu are nearby.

As expected, you spy several Vanu during your patrol and are forced to drive them off. Report all that has transpired to Ser Marielle.

Another day, another foiled attack by the Vanu. Ser Marielle is somewhat disappointed to learn that your patrol was not uneventful, but glad that you had no difficulty dispatching your foes.

# Sense of Urgency

```plaintext
System Guide

-- An undisciplined unit is a unit ripe for destruction, as Ser Marielle knows.

Marielle

-- Excepting your recent clashes with the Vanu, it cannot have escaped your notice that things here are rather peaceful─to the detriment of our garrison's discipline. Despite being built as an observation post, we have yet to record a single intrusion by the Horde. That is why, as far as everyone is concerned, Camp Cloudtop is a backwater of no significance. And of course, the pride of our camp, the vaunted Protector, is in a perpetual state of needing repairs, so even were the Holy See to come under Dravanian attack, we would be unable to fly to their aid.

-- Simply put, Mistress Kali, this is where ambition comes to die. If you haven't aspirations for advancement, you'll be right at home. However, I would like to think that enthusiasm can be just as contagious as apathy. If you'll indulge me, I would have you seek out the sentries and stoke their fighting spirit─psych them up, you might say.

-- Try to psych them up, as you might say. That should serve to liven their spirits.

-- As you wish, my lord. Should I spy an outflyer, I will alert you immediately...

Emmanellain

-- <yawn> Hello there, old girl. Slain any Vanu champions yet? No? Oh, well, let me know when you have so I can make myself presentable for...for the... <snore>

-- Is this what you do for fun? Or is it some esoteric form of training? Well then, carry on, carry on.

-- I-Is it an attack!? What should we do!? What should we do!?

-- ...You had me fooled there for a moment, old girl! An amusing jest--albeit a tad cruel. Surely you must realize how unsuited I am to the monotony of mere sentry duty--yet still you tempt me with the promise of excitement! No, this won't do. This won't do at all. Lady Laniaitte will give me a grand mission as befits my station!

House Haillenarte Knight - 1

-- Mmm ... Is there anything fluffier than a cloud...?

-- Mmm... If there is, I don't want to know about it...

-- Wh-What!? What is it!? Is it the Horde!? ...By the Fury, what ever possessed you to do that? I'm awake, I'm awake, worry not. After the shock you just gave me, I doubt I'll sleep for a fortnight!

House Haillenarte Knight - 2

-- You're looking rather grim. Why so serious? The Vanu are no real threat, and the Dravanians couldn't give a fig about us.

-- ...Aren't you an odd lass. Don't you have somewhere to be?

-- Ye gods, where did that come from? Fine, if you insist, I will make an effort to be more alert. But really, I fail to see the point! We're hundreds of malms away from the front lines─which is just the way I like it, thank you very much!

Marielle

-- Many thanks, Mistress Kali. Already I can see a change in our sentries' behavior. Beg your pardon... Lord Emmanellain said what? Hah, well... I have no doubt that Lady Laniaitte will do her utmost to oblige him.

The men and women of Camp Cloudtop have grown complacent, Ser Marielle says, as the camp has developed a reputation as a backwater of no significance in the war with Dravania. The knight cannot abide this state of affairs, and has asked you to stoke the fighting spirits of her sentries─psych them up, in her own words.

Your wild gesticulations elicit a variety of responses from the sentries, one of whom is Lord Emmanellain. Ser Marielle will doubtless find the young lord's reaction the most interesting of all.

According to Ser Marielle, there has been a noticeable change in the sentries' behavior, which she ascribes to your efforts. But when you tell her of Lord Emmanellain's sudden desire for more demanding work, she can only chuckle nervously at the thought of what is to come.

-- Ser Marielle fears what might come of Lord Emmanellain's newfound ambition.

Marielle

-- If Lord Emmanellain is going to demand a more dangerous duty, then I expect Lady Laniaitte will want you to accompany him. Aye, you might as well speak with her sooner rather than later. There's no use avoiding the inevitable.

-- You ought to go and see if Lady Laniaitte needs you to keep an eye on Lord Emmanellain. I've nothing else for you at the moment, in any case.

Emmanellain

-- I'll have you know I trained with some of the finest instructors in Ishgard! You and me, we could march right into a Vanu stronghold and give them all what for!

Honorit

-- Oh dear, oh dear...and just when everything was going so well...

Laniaitte

-- Mistreess Kali! Lord Emmanellain has just informed me that “mere sentry duty” is beneath him. I understand we have you to thank for this epiphany? Well, there's nothing for it but to give him something more demanding, then. Can I count on you to keep him safe?

-- Excellent. We are in constant need of fresh water in Camp Cloudtop, as there are no underground sources we can tap with wells. However, there is a unique variety of crystal we have recently discovered which may enable us to obtain water through other means. These spring crystals can be found in Voor Sian Siran, to the east of here. I would have you and Emmanellain bring one back to us.

-- You may have to contend with the feral beasts which populate the lakes, not to mention Vanu scouts ranging from their nearby settlement. Of course, that all pales in comparison to keeping the young lord entertained, but you have doubtless grown accustomed to that by now. Good luck, and be safe.

-- As before, I ask that you brief Emmanellain on his mission in my stead. I think he may find the task more palatable coming from you.

Emmanellain

-- Hm? Lady Laniaitte told you to tell me about my mission once again? If I didn't know any better, I'd swear she's avoiding me! Anyway, what is it?

Me

-- (Option 1) A vital mission, on the success of which the very survival of Camp Cloudtop rests: the procurement of potable water.
-- (Option 2) Go and fetch a spring crystal from the floating lakes to the east. With me.

Emmanellain

-- (In response to 1) Finally! It's about time she entrusted me with a mission of real import. Right, then─let's go, let's go!
-- (In response to 2) ...You're not making this sound terribly appealing. Still, I shall be glad to have you along. Come along, then!

Honoroit

-- I had heard the minstrels' tales of these lakes, but I never honestly believed that they were real!

Emmanellain

-- So this is the Voor Sian Siran of legend. And nary a Vanu in sight. How disappointing. I could do with some sport. I know! Why don't you and I make it a competition? Whoever finds the superior specimen wins! Honoroit shall judge our entries on size, purity, and, say, aesthetic sensibilities! Let us begin at once!

-- I wish he would have at least stayed within sight...

System

-- This water crystal does not appear to exhibit the properties described by Lady Laniaitte. Perhaps you should inspect another.

-- This crystal appears to be secreting a steady stream of water. Perhaps it is the spring crystal Lady Laniaitte seeks...

Spring Crystal (Item)

-- A cryster to aspected to water that it feels wet to the touch.

Honoroit

-- Ah, Mistress Kali. Have you brought your entry for the contest?

-- My understanding of such things is...limited, but can this truly be used to draw moisture from air like water from a pump? Fascinating...

If Lady Laniaitte acquiesces to Lord Emmanellain's demand for a more dangerous duty, then it would surely be necessary for you to accompany the young lord. Ser Marielle has asked you to return to the garrison commander and see if her fears are well founded.

Because wells cannot be dug in the Sea of Clouds, the knights of Ishgard must explore other means of obtaining potable water─perhaps through the use of a unique type of water crystal found in the floating lakes of Voor Sian Siran. Resigned to the fact that Lord Emmanellain will not be denied, Lady Laniaitte has decided to task him with the retrieval of one such crystal. This should serve to mollify the young lord.

Lord Emmanellain accepts the orders with his usual enthusiasm and sets out for Voor Sian Siran with his manservant in tow. Follow them.

Growing bored due to the absence of any discernible threat, Lord Emmanellain abruptly decides on a whim to turn your mission into a contest in which each of you searches for the finest spring crystal you can find, with Honoroit to determine the winner. Before you can speak a word of protest, the young lord runs off, and you have no choice but to indulge his whim.

You come upon what you judge to be a particularly impressive spring crystal. Hopefully Honoroit will feel the same.

Honoroit ponders the unique properties of the spring crystal, including how it can be used to draw moisture from the air like water from a pump. It would seem you were the first to return and present him with an entry, for Lord Emmanellain is nowhere to be seen...
