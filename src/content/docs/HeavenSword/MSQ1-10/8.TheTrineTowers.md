## The Trine Towers🎧

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Ysayle wishes to survey the approach to the distant towers.

Ysayle

-- Spy you the three great towers to the west? Ishgardians know them as Anyx Trine. The place serves as a roost for Hraesvelgr's lesser kindred. If we are to reach the peak of Sohm Al, then we must first beseech these dragons to open the way. But do not be disheartened─the one who leads them is a friend. Of rather more concern is the disposition of the Gnath. Let us survey the approach to the towers, and see if the path is clear.

Alphinaud

-- The Gnath are fast becoming a nuisance. They seem to plague our every step.

Estinien

-- Hmph. 'Twould seem the enemy of mine enemy is also mine enemy.

Ysayle

-- 'Tis as I feared: the road ahead is teeming with Gnath soldiers.

Alphinaud

-- Marcechamp did not exaggerate, then. These beastmen have grown brazen indeed if they would threaten the dragons so openly. Do they intend to assault the lair itself...?

Ysayle

-- I pray they do not... Mighty though my Dravanian friends are, they are yet vulnerable to the Gnath's muskets. There is no route save the one before us. Should the beastmen offer battle, we have no choice but to accept.

Alphinaud

-- The scale of this structure is nothing short of astounding... But that is only to be expected, I suppose, given the size of its occupants.

Ysayle

-- I take no pleasure in killing the Gnath. 'Twas to avoid bloodshed that I agreed to join you on this journey. ...Well, it cannot be helped. We may proceed into the courtyard together--but leave the task of hailing its occupants to me. And keep your lance on your back, dragoon.

Estinien

-- On my word to the Warrior of Light, I shall start no fight...only finish it.

Ysayle

-- Vidonir!

Vidofnir

-- Ah, 'tis thee, Little One. From above, I did mistake thee for a Gnath. 'Tis well I chanced to look again, or thou wouldst now be ash.

Ysayle

-- Dear Vidofnir...how I have missed you. Would that I had come sooner...and not out of dire necessity.

Vidofnir

-- Thou art troubled. Speak, that I might know thy plight.

-- Thou wouldst have Father admonish his brood-brother?

Ysayle

-- I would end this war without further bloodshed. 

Vidofnir

-- How am I to believe thee, Little One...when thine own companion beareth Nidhogg's stolen eye!?

Estinien

-- Have care, dragon...or I shall gouge out one of yours.

Ysayle

-- You forget yourself, ser! We are here on a mission of peace!

Vidofnir

-- My sire's will forbiddeth me from inviting discord to our home... 'Tis for this reason, and no other, that thou still drawest breath, knight.

Ysayle

-- Vidofnir, please─we must be allowed to convey our intentions to Hraesvelgr in person, with words of our own choosing. Grant us this favor, and open the way to Sohm Al!

Vidofnir

-- Thou hast ever been welcome, Little One. ...But I cannot grant thy wish. I am bound to remain here, and protect my kin from the Gnath's god.

Ysayle

-- The Gnath have summoned a primal!?

Alphinaud

-- Pray excuse my forwardness, but if we were to eliminate the threat to your territory, would you consent to Lady Ysayle's request?

Vidofnir

-- Ha! Dost thou imagine thyself equal to the task─to succeed where dragons have failed? 'Tis beyond thee, mortal. But thou art welcome to try, nonetheless. Only know that idle promises shall avail thee naught!

Ysayle

-- It would seem we have no choice but to make good on Alphinaud's offer. Why must our every bid for peace breed yet more war?

Alphinaud

-- Once more a primal rears its head, and once more the task of slaying it falls to you. Would that I, too, possessed the Echo...

Estinien

-- By the Fury... Must we now defeat a primal, that we might treat with a wyrm? I do begin to see how you gained your reputation for surmounting the insurmountable...

Ysayle tells you of the three towers known as Anyx Trine, and of the dragons that dwell within. Without their cooperation, she claims, the way to Sohm Al's summit will remain closed. Meet your companions on the approach to Anyx Trine, and speak with Ysayle once more.

Ysayle notes with dismay that Gnath forces have occupied the road to Anyx Trine. Cut a path through their ranks, and gain entrance to the towers.

You have defeated a group of Gnath soldiers. Continue towards Anyx Trine, defeating any resistance you encounter.

Once more, you are forced to weather a storm of Gnath hostility. Resume your march along the path, and speak with Ysayle at the entrance to Anyx Trine.

Upon entering the courtyard of Anyx Trine, Ysayle hails the dragon Vidofnir--the friend of whom she spoke earlier. Though apparently willing to open the way to Sohm Al's summit, the Dravanian declares that she cannot leave her post unguarded for fear of the Gnath's god. Suddenly, the beastmen's aggression begins to make sense--they act under the influence of a primal. Pausing only to seek your approval, Alphinaud offers to slay the creature, that Vidofnir might assist you in turn.

## Gifts for the Outcasts

System Guide

-- Ysayle seems occipied with thoughts of the Gnath and their primal.

Ysayle

-- So, the Gnath have summoned their god... And thus is the mystery of their newfound belligerence laid to rest.

Estinien

-- Are you not glad, Lady Iceheart? I thought you would applaud them for summoning a primal to further their own ends. After all...you did.

Ysayle

-- I did not reach out to Saint Shiva to further mine own ends! I desired her strength only to forge anew the peace between man and dragon! But what a fool I am to speak of peace to you--a bloodthirsty savage who murders without thought or compunction!

Alphinaud

-- Enough! Enough, I say! If the Gnath have truly brought forth their deity from the aether, we must face it together or watch our hopes fall apart! All now rests upon this primal's defeat. ...But ere we think of confronting it, we must first study its origins. What is the nature of this god? What manner of faith sustains its existence?

Ysayle

-- ...My apologies. You are right, of course. Let us return to Tailfeather and consult with Marcechamp─he knows more of the Gnath and their culture than most.

Marcechamp

-- Oho! Back already, are we? ...Hm? Ah, met the Gnath, did you? And what is it you'd like to─

-- Summoned a primal, you say!? Seven hells... Well, I don't know bugger all about Gnath religion, if I'm honest. Beyond their tradin' habits, there never seemed much point in askin'. But it shouldn't be that hard to find out. From time to time, we barter with a small hive to the north and west of here─outcasts from the main tribe, from what I understand. I reckon they'd be willin' to tell you a bit about 'emselves...if you give 'em the right incentives.

Alphinaud

-- That sounds promising. And what exactly would a Gnath consider to be “the right incentives”?

Marcechamp

-- Oh, nothin' your average hunter couldn't scrounge up in a day or two. But seein' as you're in a hurry, you might want to divide the chores amongst yourselves. You'll want a good-sized jar of landtrap nectar, a basket of caelumtree fruit, and─always a Gnath favorite--a generous portion of young nanka flesh.

Estinien

-- I shall gather the fruit--leaping to the lower branches of these forest giants should present little challenge to me.

Ysayle

-- Then I shall collect the nectar...with Master Alphinaud's arcane assistance.

Marcechamp

-- An' that leaves you to bring home the meat. You'll need to carve it from the smaller nankas that live in the rivers--three big hunks should be enough, I reckon. Once you've got everythin' together, you'll need to set it down at what we call the “tradin' post.” Here─I'll mark the spot on your map for you.

Alphinaud

-- You have been most kind, Master Marcechamp. Well, then! Let us attend to our respective tasks, and reconvene at the trading post. I need hardly add that the last one there is a rotten nanka egg!

Marcechamp

-- You're in charge of gatherin' the nanka flesh, right? You'll find the beasts down by the riverbanks--just be sure to avoid the bigger ones carryin' the unhatched spawn on their backs. I reckon three good hunks ought to do it. Soon as you've got 'em, head over to the tradin' post I marked on your map, an' add 'em to your mates' offerin's. Simple.

-- When I set out to master the dragoon's jump, 'twas not to strike fear into the hearts of high-hanging fruit.

Ysayle

-- Master Alphinaud possesses a rare talent for the arcane arts. Should he continue to apply himself to their study, he will become a formidable mage in time.

Alphinaud

-- I was able to gather a goodly amount of nectar from the landtraps─though I would not have known how to harvest it without Ysayle's help. Do you have the nanka meat?

-- Splendid. I shall put this with Estinien's fruit and assemble a suitably generous--looking hamper for the Gnath.

When Ysayle and Estinien set to bickering once more, Alphinaud again seeks to direct their energies toward the mission at hand. The young Scion contemplates the sobering issue of the Gnath's deity, and the need for additional information with which to plot its defeat. Professing to have little knowledge of Gnath culture, Ysayle suggests returning to Tailfeather to consult with Marcechamp. Speak with the village leader, and learn what he knows of the beast tribe's customs and beliefs.

Though he has often traded with the Gnath, Marcechamp admits that his knowledge of their faith and culture is scant at best. He suggests that you prepare an assortment of gifts, and barter with the outcast members of the beast tribe for the information you require. Slay clearwater nankas in the Whilom River, and gather hunks of flesh by way of an offering.

You have collected several hunks of nanka flesh. Head north of the Stained One, and deliver them to the waiting Alphinaud.

Alphinaud takes the nanka flesh, and adds it to the nectar and caelumtree fruit collected by the others. All that remains is to place the assorted offerings at the trading post, and hope that the outcast Gnath are in the mood to trade...

-- Alphinaud is eager to make contact with the Gnath.

Alphinaud

-- Well, everything appears to be in order. Assuming no one has any objections to my choice of presentation, I shall place our offerings at the trading post as instructed. Were I of the Gnath, I think I would be suitably impressed.

-- Well? How long must we wait? Should we have sounded a signal or some such?

Estinien

-- Calm yourself, Master Alphinaud. Our offering has not gone unnoticed.

Vath Fleetfoot

-- <click> <click> Long has it been since hunters last came to trade, bearing gifts that filled the air with such delightful scents. Landtrap nectar! Caelumtree fruit! And nanka flesh! What delectable foods you have brought for us. Our meager existence is much enriched by your bounty. <click> <click> Come, hunters. Come to our hive if you would trade. Cramped and stifling our homes are, but the rancid incense keeps the dragons at bay. Cramped! Stifling! And horribly smelly! But better to live in stench than be cracked and crunched by dragon jaws, yes? Come, come, it is not far.

Estinien

-- ...Strangely friendly, are they not? Or mayhap just strange.

Ysayle

-- These Gnath seem harmless enough. Almost jovial, even. I would prefer, however, that we conclude our business with them as soon as possible.

Alphinaud

Vath Fleetfoot

-- Your presence has been announced to the storyteller. You must speak to our chosen leader in words, for we are Vath. We are the Nonmind. The storyteller awaits you. If you wish to trade, then it is to him that you must speak.

Vath Storyteller

-- Welcome to our hive, hunters. You have brought delicacies much sought after by our people, and we are much pleased. What would you have in return?

Alphinaud

-- Honored elder─pray allow me to begin by thanking you for welcoming us into your home, and for accepting our humble offerings. My companions and I are come in search of knowledge─specifically, knowledge of your people's god.

Vath Storyteller

-- Knowledge alone? What strange hunters you are! But if it is words you desire, then words you shall have! We are the Vath--the Nonmind--and to speak is our fate! You will hear the tale of the Gnath's god--of the god the Onemind summoned into our midst.

Ysayle

-- The “Onemind”...these are the Gnath who reside in the main colony?

Vath Storyteller

-- Yes, they are one. Connected. But let us begin the story at its beginning... Some moons ago, a single dragon flew in from the east, bleeding and weak. It fell from the sky and into the hive, where it was swarmed by my brethren. And with spear, and spell, and musket, the dragon was slain.

Estinien

-- 'Twas likely one that had fled battle with my kinsmen. I should commend you for finishing the job.

Vath Storyteller

-- Dragons are fierce and terrible adversaries. The Onemind would always cower when their winged shadows passed over the ground. But no longer--they had learned that a battle--weary Dravanian was easy prey. Thus did the Overmind decide to heed the words of the black-robed men. The Onemind would call forth our god, and unleash His blades upon the dragons...Dravanian lands would become Gnath lands, and ever larger would grow our domain. But our god ever hungers. The price He demands in crystals far exceeds the rewards for this war. We of the Vath despise and revile His insatiable existence!

Estinien

-- Even a wounded dragon is a dangerous opponent─these antmen did well to overpower one.

Alphinaud

-- The beast tribes have ever summoned their gods out of necessity. That the Gnath should do so out of mere covetousness sets a worrying precedent...

Alphinaud places your collective offerings at the trading post, and you are soon approached by three curiously affable Gnath. They seem well pleased with the goods, and your party is invited to their nearby hive to trade. Enter Loth ast Vath, and speak with the Vath fleetfoot you met earlier.

You enter the grounds of the Vath hive, and the Gnath you spoke with at the trading post directs you to the hive's chosen leader. Approach the Vath storyteller and barter for information.

The storyteller welcomes you to the hive, and willingly relates the circumstances that led to the summoning of his tribe's predictably crystal-hungry primal. Unfortunately, nothing the Vath leader tells you offers any clue as to how you might go about defeating the insatiable creature...

## A Gnathic Deity

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Ysayle seems troubled by the Gnath's war of expansion.

Ysayle

-- I call upon the power of a primal for the greater good...conscious all the while that I do so at grave cost to the land. I reason that it is a necessary evil, and willingly shoulder the burden of my sin. In suggesting that such crimes can be justified, you may argue that I presume too much--but you must surely see that I am aware of the magnitude of my transgressions. Not so the Gnath. They summon their deity for no greater purpose than to expand their dominion.

Alphinaud

-- To a Scion of the Seventh Dawn--one sworn to eliminate the primal threat--the distinction you draw seems questionable at best. But the fact remains that my own grandfather risked unleashing the power of the Twelve in an attempt to prevent the Calamity. Thus, while I may not condone your actions, I at least understand them. Not so the Gnath, as you so rightly put it. If they truly seek naught but territorial gain, I can only conclude that they are ignorant of the ruinous consequences of their god's insatiable appetite. The longer this primal is suffered to exist, the greater the suffering it will cause. It must be destroyed.

Estinien

-- How lightly you propose the destruction of this god, Master Alphinaud─a being of whom we know naught. Has it occurred to you that you may be sending the Warrior of Light to her death?

Alphinaud

-- No, I─ <sigh> ...You have the right of it, Estinien. 'Twould seem it is I who am guilty of presuming too much. Pray forgive me, Luna.

Ysayle

-- Wait. Luna need not face this foe alone. Like her, I am blessed with the Echo's protection, and may do battle without fear of primal influence. Let me bear this burden.

Estinien

-- Ha! Do you truly imagine yourself a second Warrior of Light? Remind me: how many primals have you faced, my lady? Not that it matters─we know not where this god resides, or how to challenge it. Unless you mean to pray until it appears?

Alphinaud

-- Hm. Estinien makes a valid point. Let us speak with the Vath, and learn how best to secure an audience with their deity. In this, at least, I may be of assistance.

Estinien

-- The young lord certainly appears eager to prove his worth...

Vath Fleetfoot

-- Put this idea from your minds, generous hunters. If you meet with our god, then He will have your souls. Surely you are not so generous as that?

Vath Chronicler

-- The hunters who seek only words. I have many to share. Come and listen.

-- What once was known to all is now known to one. I record the words of the Nonmind so that none may be lost. The Onemind has no need of chronicles. Young or old, all is known. But the Nonmind must learn. Must teach. Must grow. It is...strange...to be with so many but alone. But this has ever been your way, yes? If hunters can preserve the wisdom of their elders, then so can we.

-- The Onemind speak with one voice. One will. When that connection is lost--when one is made Vath--one must find a new voice. Some will lie and be found and cast out. Others will wander and never return. Those who can endure come to Loth ast Vath, the hive of the Nonmind. We who have been severed are similar but different. We have...preferences. It can be difficult...but also interesting. Very interesting.

Vath Storyteller

-- You wish to meet our god? Offer yourself as a sacrifice, and you will soon be brought before Him. We would mourn the loss of such generous hunters, however...

Cibleroit

-- We are Vath. We are the Nonmind. We do not hear the Onemind's thoughts. We cannot predict their will.

Voracious Vath

-- You are generous hunters, yes? Many gifts you have brought, but not enough for all Vath to enjoy. Maybe you could bring us just one more? We are very fond of nanka flesh. Yes, the meat of a young nanka would make a fine repast.

Ysayler

-- For once, I am in agreement with the dragoon. Speaking with these beastmen is an exercise in frustration.

Alphinaud

-- The Vath tell me that their tribe is not accustomed to giving each individual a name. It seems they only grasped the concept after they began trading with the hunters.

Estinien

-- And what has that to do with their primal or their faith, Master Alphinaud? Let us glean the information we require, and be done with this place...

Voracious Vath

-- Another gift for the Vath!? So unexpected! Mmm, yes, you will have more of the words you strange hunters hunger for. Listen, now. The senses of the Onemind are enmeshed by the Overmind--what one sees, all see; what one feels, all feel. Alert a single Gnath, and the whole hive is alerted. To reach our god undetected is all but impossible! The senses of the Onemind are enmeshed by the Overmind─what one sees, all see; what one feels, all feel. Alert a single Gnath, and the whole hive is alerted. To reach our god undetected is all but impossible!

Estinien

-- I do not envy the antmen their bond. Were every man's mind made known to his neighbor, Ishgard would not last a bell.

Ysayle

-- How strange must spoken language seem to those who once shared minds... 'Tis little wonder the Vath are by turns so obscure and transparent in their meaning.

Alphinaud

-- The Vath are wont to allude to certain concepts without explanation, but I believe I am beginning to grasp a few of the fundamentals. From what I understand, the king-like “Overmind” sits at the center of Gnath society, and its presence somehow allows its subjects to communicate without need of word or gesture. These Gnath─the ones who inhabit the larger hive--are known as the “Onemind,” and it was by their combined will that the primal was summoned. Those who reside in this smaller hive, however, are the Vath--or the “Nonmind”--who, for reasons that yet escape me, seem to have been excluded from the telepathic bond which connects their Gnath counterparts. Thus are the Vath ignorant of the Onemind's thoughts and intentions.

Estinien

-- ...And of the nature of their own god. In summary, we have wasted our time.

Ysayle

-- Not so. Perilous though it may be, the Vath did furnish us with one certain method of approaching the primal: as sacrifices. Should we allow ourselves to be captured in the environs of the colony, the Gnath will bring us before their deity to make an offering of our souls...

Estinien

-- I will admit, I had begun to wonder whether “Nonmind” meant “brainless.” Apparently not.

Ysayle

-- All rests upon the destruction of the Gnath's god. If we must surrender ourselves for sacrifice to approach the abomination, freely will I do it.

Ysayle questions the Gnath's justification for committing the crime of summoning, drawing a distinction between their expansionist aims and her own hopes for peace. Alphinaud concludes that if the beastmen are truly only motivated by territorial gain, they must be unaware of the terrible price that their god's presence exacts from the land. Plainly, the creature must die. Citing the protection afforded her by the Echo, Ysayle volunteers to confront the primal, but Estinien is quick to point out that she lacks the means to call it forth. Speak with the inhabitants of Loth ast Vath, and learn more about the Gnath and their god.

You have gleaned what knowledge you can from the hive's residents, but it seems there is one more inhabitant who is eager to share. Speak with the voracious Vath, and hear what he has to say.

You approach the voracious Vath, and he hints that more information will be forthcoming should he receive a gift from the “generous hunters.” Seek out the clearwater nankas, and obtain a hunk of their flesh.

You have obtained a hunk of nanka flesh. Return to Loth ast Vath and deliver the gift to the voracious Vath.

Having hungrily taken receipt of the nanka flesh, the Vath explains how the thoughts and senses of every Gnath in the main colony are linked by the presence of the Overmind. Discuss the implications of this revelation with Alphinaud.

You share your findings with the rest of the party, and Alphinaud summarizes what you have learned of Gnath society. Though Estinien is unimpressed with the Vath's meager knowledge of their own god, Ysayle believes that the elder's offhand suggestion--that you surrender yourselves as sacrifices--may hold some merit...

## Breaking into Hives

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Alphinaud wishes to review Ysayle's plan for infiltration the Gnath hive.

Alphinaud

-- Forgive me, but let us be clear about what it is that you propose. You mean to say that you would deliberately provoke the Gnath, surrender yourself into what might generously be termed their “custody,” and then wait until their god arrives to claim your soul?

Ysayle

-- Aye, that fairly well describes my plan. You will join me in this endeavor, will you not, Luna? Judging by the great risks you took to prevent the summoning of Saint Shiva, you are not a woman to err on the side of caution.

Estinien

-- ...Would that I could fight at your side, Warrior of Light. But the power of the dragon is no protection against primal influence. Forgive me, but I must remain here with Master Alphinaud.

Ysayle

-- Then it is settled. Luna, you and I shall challenge the guards at the entrance to the colony. Once the hive is roused, we shall feign a brief show of resistance, and then allow them to take us prisoner.

Alphinaud

-- Estinien's words stung me more than I care to admit--'twould seem I have begun to take your victories for granted. Do be cautious, my friend...

Estinien

-- I would be curious to test my lance against a beast tribe's god, but I cannot risk falling under its sway. Tell me of the battle upon your return, Warrior of Light.

Ysayle

-- Be at the ready, Luna--kicking the ants' nest will summon no few of its defenders.

Gnath Drone

-- Intruders! Your lives are forfeit!

Ysayle

-- The Overmind must by now be aware of our intrusion. Let us press on into the hive, and ensure that we have our hosts' undivided attention.

-- Leave these drones to me. We can join forces again once we are deeper within the colony!

-- That should be sufficient. If we did not have our hosts' full attention before, we must surely have it now... Our audience with the primal may be granted soon after our capture. Pray advise me once you have steeled your mind for the battle to come.

Despite Alphinaud's misgivings, Ysayle seems determined to surrender herself to the Gnath, in the belief that this will bring her within striking distance of their god. Needless to say, she wants you to join her. Lacking any protection from the primal's influence, Alphinaud and Estinien will remain behind while you and Ysayle mount a mock assault upon the hive. Make your way to the main colony, and provoke the sentry stationed at the approach to Loth ast Gnath.

You have defeated the drones at the entrance to the colony, and alerted the hive to your presence. Plan your next move with Ysayle.

Though the colony must by now be aware of your intrusion, Ysayle seems determined to capture the Gnath's undivided attention. Press on into the heart of the hive, killing anything that stands in your way.

You have fought your way deeper into the hive. Wait for Ysayle to join you, then discuss the next step of your plans.

Ysayle is satisfied that your mock assault upon the colony has served its purpose. All that remains is to surrender yourself to capture...and pray that the Gnath drag you before their god.
