## Sounding Out the Amphitheatre

System Guide

-- Alphinaud seems intent on traveling to the Akh Afah Amphitheatre.

Alphinaud

-- The Akh Afah Amphitheatre... The very place where you witnessed the manifestation of the primal Shiva, was it not? If that is our destination, the journey will be long indeed. The amphitheatre lies on the other side of a treacherous tract of ice and snow that cannot swiftly be crossed. Then we must place our faith in the Aethernet. As you may recall, our dear friend Moenbryda succeeded in recreating the Akh Afah beacon after it had been destroyed by Lady Iceheart. At the time, it was assumed that the resultant aetheryte would only be temporarily viable, but given that the heretics of Gorgagne Mills seem to have been in regular contact with their brethren at the amphitheatre, I'll wager it still functions. I suggest we make for the aetheryte within Snowcloak without delay. Correct me if I am wrong, Estinien, but in the course of mapping the Snowcloak tunnel system, a passage was discovered leading out into the western highlands, was it not? Might it be possible for us to reach the aetheryte from this side of the wall?

Estinien

-- It should. House Durendaire posted soldiers at the western highlands entrance after the tunnels were cleared, but they will not deny us entry.

Alphinaud

-- Do you recall the first time you ventured into these tunnels in search of Lady Iceheart? It seems an age ago, does it not...? Back then, I still believed myself the commander of the Crystal Braves...

Estinien

-- What ails our young lord? The moment we arrived at the wall, his face took on an ashen pallor. Does he fear facing the heretics within their own lair?

Tristechambel

-- Ah, the guests of House Fortemps...accompanied by the Azure Dragoon, no less! I cannot imagine what brought you out this far, but you are welcome to enter the tunnels if that is your will.

Alphinaud

-- Assuming the Akh Afah beacon still functions--and we must pray to the Twelve it does--we shall arrive at our destination in mere moments. Though I do not expect to be greeted by the primal Shiva, we should nevertheless be prepared for a frosty reception. ...The heretics are not like to rejoice at the appearance of uninvited guests─particularly ones with our history.

Adelphel

-- We have begun surveying the Warrens from the western entrance, but progress is slow. 'Twould seem not all the rats have left the nest...

Alphinaud

-- An impressive structure. I wonder how many ages it has endured...

Estinien

-- Mayhap you should ask its occupants. They seem a friendly bunch.

Heretic 

-- Dogs of Ishgard! Is it not enough that you banish our beloved saint? Will you not be satisfied until the ice is slick with the last drops of our blood!?

Alphinaud

-- Stay your weapons! We come under the flag of parley! We wish only to speak with your mistress, that we might broker a peace!

Heretic

-- Do you think us fools, boy!? It will take more than honeyed words to earn our trust. You walk with the dragonslayer, and we know all too well what he is capable of!

Estinien

-- My reputation precedes me...

Alphinaud

-- <sigh> ...They give us little choice.

Heretic

-- <gasp> Th-They fight like demons... 'Tis death to remain! Fall back, brothers! Retreat to the Cinders!

Alphinaud

-- I see no sign of Lady Iceheart. Would that we could have questioned one of them...

Estinien

-- What would you ask that we do not already know? They make for the Cinders, and so must we. Even should an ambush await us, 'tis certain there will be more heretics to question.

Alphinaud

-- “The Cinders,” you say? I confess, the name is unknown to me. Mayhap you would be so good as to enlighten us, Estinien?

Estinien

-- ...I suspect it is the heretics' way of referring to the Dreaming Dragon--an island of sorts found in the midst of the frozen lake of Ashpool. Some five hundred years past, 'tis told that the Azure Dragoon of the age fought a dragon of titanic proportions. After a savage struggle, the mighty creature was weakened unto the point of death, and forced into a magicked slumber by an entire chapter of the Holy See's sorcerers. Ere long, a rain of ash and cinders did begin to fall upon the sleeping serpent's motionless form, covering the creature at length in a shroud of grey. ...Of course, a thick layer of ice has since formed on top of it, but you may be sure I speak true.

Alphinaud

-- A fascinating tale. We should make haste to this ashen isle.

-- Only in a land where war has raged for a thousand years could enough ash fall to bury a dragon the size of an island...

Tristechambel

-- What...? You've driven off the heretics? That should certainly ease the minds of our surveyors!

Adelphel

Estinien

-- The Dreaming Dragon lies far to the west. Before we approach the frozen beast, however, there is another place I would visit first. I am told the Convictors have set up camp in Twinpools. Their leader, Jantellot, may have information of use to us. Ah, but mayhap you are not familiar with that name, either... The Convictors are dragonslayers--after a fashion--but I am willing to wager that they encounter their fair share of heretics. If we are indeed walking into a trap, I would learn all there is to know of our foe.

Alphinaud

-- A sound suggestion. Let us speak with these Convictors, then, and temper our haste with a measure of caution.

Jantellot 

-- Well, well. What do we have here? Hoping to join the esteemed ranks of the Convictors, are we? The hard-eyed lass looks promising, but you have a frail look about you, boy... I give you three days ere the wilds claim your corpse.

Alphinaud

-- I beg your pardon...?

Estinien

-- Be not so quick to judge. I have seen this “frail” youth fell heretics with a flick of his wrist.

Jantellot

-- And who are you to question my--By the Fury! That armor... That lance! The Azure Dragoon himself graces our camp! Pray forgive my disrespect, ser. I am Jantellot--leader of the Convictors and fellow slayer of dragons. ...May I ask what winds─fair or foul─carry you into our humble camp?

-- Ah. Lady Iceheart, is it? Aye, I know her by reputation--but I'm afraid I've seen naught of her or her people. That said, my own men can be...ahem...somewhat lax when it comes to making reports. You may wish to question them yourselves.

Alphinaud

-- Thank you. We shall. Luna, Estinien--let us make our way through the camp, and see what information there is to be had.

Upon learning that the Akh Afah Amphitheatre may yet harbor your quarry, Alphinaud suggests employing the swiftest means of travel available─the aetheryte found within the Warrens of Snowcloak. Speak with the House Durendaire guard stationed at the tunnel entrance in the western highlands.

You enter the Akh Afah Amphitheatre, and soon cross paths with its heretical occupants. Though Alphinaud declares his intention to parley, the heretics are not inclined to trust his word, and the encounter quickly devolves into violence--an unwanted conflict from which you and your fellows emerge triumphant yet frustrated. With naught save the parting words of the retreating heretics on which to rely, you have little choice but to investigate the island known as the Dreaming Dragon. Speak with Estinien at the entrance to the Warrens, and plan the next step of your journey.

Before making for the Dreaming Dragon, Estinien suggests that you visit a group of dragonslayers known as the Convictors who have pitched camp in the region of Twinpools. Speak with the Convictors' leader, Jantellot, and learn what he knows of the heretics and their island lair.

Your meeting with the honored leader of the Convictors serves to convince you of two things: first, that Jantellot is ignorant of Iceheart's movements, and second, that he is only marginally better informed about those of his own men. After freely admitting that his fellow dragonslayers often fail to share information with him, he invites you to question them yourselves.

-- Alphinaud is eager to gather information on the heretics.

Alphinaud

-- Surely one of these people will have encountered heretics while out hunting. Pray speak with as many as you can, Luna.

-- While this is, I confess, a somewhat tedious business, one of these people may have valuable knowledge that will save us days of searching.

Estinien

-- ...I may have erred in seeking the wisdom of these whelps.

Jantellot

-- I've not seen Lady Iceheart myself, but we Convictors range far and wide in search of our prey. Mayhap one of my fellow dragonslayers has a helpful tale to tell.

Boorish Banneret

-- Nay, I know of no heretics. Do you honestly expect me to keep track of every Raitmeaux, Vairemont, and Bertennant that wanders in and out of camp?

Boorish Bowman

-- Hm? Are there any heretics in the area? I have not the faintest idea. Why, a heretic could pass under my very nose and I should be none the wiser. I hunt dragons, my dear lady! The big ones! Forever do I scan the skies for signs of my prey─I care not for the miserable creatures that scurry upon the ground!

Luciae

-- Looking for heretics, you say? Hmph. Why don't you go and bother Pierriquet or someone? I've enough trouble keeping these preening fops fed and clothed as it is. 'Tis no business of mine what folk do with themselves out there in the wilds.

Pierriquet

-- Summat I can help you with, milady?

-- Heretics, is it? Well, I've never seen one meself...but that ain't to say I haven't heard a thing or two.

Alphinaud

-- We would be grateful for any information you can share with us. The gods know we've gleaned precious little from talking to the rest of these...people.

Pierriquet

-- If it please milord, I'm Pierriquet--a soldier by trade, though not much of one, if I'm honest. It weren't for the love of stabbing folk that I took up the spear, see. No, it was by order of Ser Jantellot's father. Still, as long as they keep paying me wages, I ain't fussy as to what they have me do. Not everyone's as patient as me, though. Plenty of lowborn lads who get pressed into service start grumbling before they've seen their second battle. And once they've got to thinking how unfair it all is, it don't take much for the heretics to turn their heads. From what I hear, the simple promise of freedom tends to do it.

Alphinaud

-- That may explain how Lady Iceheart was able to expand her following so swiftly.

Pierriquet

-- Sad to say, some mates of mine gobbled down the heretics' tripe and asked for seconds--told me they were off to the western highlands to light a signal fire. That's how you let the heretics know you're serious about joining their ranks, apparently. Send up some purple smoke, and the bastards come to you.

Alphinaud asks that you aid him in questioning the Convictors. Make your way around the camp, and learn what you can of the heretic presence in the area.

To your frustration, none of the Convictors seem to know anything about Lady Iceheart or her followers. Try questioning the soldier Pierriquet.

After fruitlessly interrogating dragonslayers of all descriptions, the lowborn soldier, Pierriquet, finally provides you with a valuable piece of information. According to him, heretics in the western highlands are summoned with purple-hued signal smoke. Perhaps your quarry can be made to come to you...

Estinien

-- If we are to lure our foes to our position, then we must find a means of producing a signal of purple hue. ...As it so happens, I once heard the tale of a trapper who dropped the hide of a wooly yak onto his campfire. Aside from the terrible stench, the story also described in detail how the smoke from the smothered flames was tinged a deep violet. You are a monster hunter of some note, are you not, Luna? It should prove a trifling task for you to procure a number of hides. We may need to burn more than one ere the heretics notice our beacon. Master Alphinaud. You and I shall gather wood for the fire. Aye, it will take the both of us to find enough dry fuel in this frozen wasteland. Let us meet again at the Dreaming Dragon with the fruits of our labor.

Iceheart

-- Ah, I should have known it would be you... Word reached me of a struggle with a small but well-armed band of trespassers. Forgive my comrades their hostility--few come here uninvited, and fewer still with good intent. Now, tell me why you are here.

-- So, you seek to stem the Dravanian tide with talk? A romantic notion. If you but knew the truth--the spark which lit the flames of this animosity--you would understand the futility of your quest. Shall I relate it to you? The sordid history my gift has shown me? That which the Holy See has taken such pains to suppress? 

-- 'Twas more than a millennium past when an Elezen tribe first sought to claim the lands of Coerthas as its home. Unfortunately for them, Coerthas was already home to dragonkind, and they were not inclined to make way for the invaders. Thus did a bloody war begin--a war which might well have rumbled on until one or the other side was exterminated, had it not been for the resolve of a single woman. That woman's name was “Shiva.” While those around her fought and died, she attempted to parley with the dragons, and in so doing discovered them to be possessed of profound intelligence and reason. The great wyrm Hraesvelgr in particular so enchanted Shiva that she found herself growing to love the creature, whom her people considered a monster. In the eyes of a near-immortal dragon, however, the fleeting life of an Elezen is as that of a freshly cut rose--scarce has the flower bloomed before it begins to fade and wither. Such melancholy musings plagued Hraesvelgr, who had found in Shiva an unexpected and beloved soulmate. He knew that all too soon, death would snatch her away from him. Unable to bear the thought of their separation, the maid bid the wyrm consume her, that their spirits might be entwined for eternity. ...Though loath to perform the deed, Hraesvelgr ultimately gave in to her plea, and soon thereafter, the tale of their ill-fated love spread throughout the two warring factions. No more could they raise blade or claw against one another, knowing that the souls of their kin were so inextricably bound. In the days that followed, man and dragon learned to live in harmony, and together built a nation unlike any the world had ever known. For two hundred years did this blissful age of peace continue, as it would to this day, had vilest envy not stirred in the hearts of the Elezen. It is said that wyrms owe their longevity to the boundless reserves of vitality found within their eyes--and 'twas in this belief that a traitorous band of knights deceived their allies of some two centuries, and took by force that which they coveted...

-- Nidhogg--he who now stands poised to unleash his wyrmlings upon Ishgard--was the great dragon who lost an eye to Elezen treachery. And until he prises it from the hands of the traitors' progeny, no amount of conciliatory words will stay his fury.

Estinien

-- You are wrong, Lady Iceheart. Lest you misunderstand, I do not doubt your vision of the past─'tis true that Nidhogg greatly desired to reclaim the Eye. Indeed, it was for that very reason that I kept it with me as I roamed the land, attempting to draw him away from the city. Until recently, Nidhogg seemed unable to resist its allure, and pursued me relentlessly. Needless to say, that is no longer the case. Now, it would seem he has fixed his attention on Ishgard itself, though he knows full well the Eye does not reside there.

Iceheart

-- You believe he targets the capital for another reason...?

Estinien

-- I believe reason has all but left him. Through the Eye, I feel much of what Nidhogg feels, and the dragon's thirst for vengeance will not be quenched by aught less than a sea of blood.

-- If Nidhogg is indeed lost to reason, might we not seek an audience with Hraesvelgr instead? He has thus far shown no inclination to aid in the invasion of Ishgard, and may yet welcome our efforts to broker a peace.

Iceheart

-- You still believe that a peaceable solution can be found? Very well. I will take you to him. Our road will lead us to Dravania, the homeland of dragonkind. There we shall ascend unto the clouds, where Hraesvelgr resides...

Alphinaud

-- Is aught amiss, my friend? I sense the many battles are beginning to take their toll. Rest awhile. And should you lose sight of us--Dravania lies beyond the mountains to the west.

Midgardsormr

-- Curious... The vestiges of thy mistress's blessing are not as faint as once they were... Thy will to succeed grants thee unusual fortitude. But will it be enough...?

Estinien seems eager to put the Convictory behind him and begin gathering materials for the signal fire. While he and Alphinaud search for a supply of dry wood, you are to hunt down a number of lumbering yaks. Head to the yaks' territory, and obtain two of their hides.

You have acquired two wooly yak hides. Make your way to the Dreaming Dragon and deliver them to Estinien.

Estinien builds a small fire, and adds pieces of the hides you collected to produce a thick purple smoke. It is not long before Lady Iceheart herself arrives to investigate the signal. You explain your desire to parley with Nidhogg, but the heretics' mistress quickly dismisses the plan as futile. She relates the history of treachery that fuels the great wyrm's wrath, and Estinien, though disagreeing on the point of Nidhogg's present goal, concedes that the maddened beast is unlikely to listen to reason. Alphinaud then suggests that speaking with Hraesvelgr, another of the seven great wyrms, may provide a more promising chance at peace. Lady Iceheart insists upon accompanying your party, and offers to lead you to Hraesvelgr's lair. As you resolve to depart for the dragons' homeland, the light of your Crystal of Ice suddenly flares once more...

## Where the Chocobos Roam🎧

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Lady Iceheart stands ready to lead you and your companions into Dravania.

Alphinaud

-- We journey to the homeland of dragons, Luna. The scholar within me burns to see the sights I have but read about...as does the child within me, I confess.

Estinien

-- Be on your guard, Warrior of Light. With the mistress of the heretics as our guide, we may yet find that we are being led to our graves.

Ysayle

-- You are Luna, yes? Pray address me as “Ysayle” if you wish. ...'Tis passing strange, is it not, that fate should bring us together thus. Never did I think to walk alongside the Warrior of Light. ...But history is full of such unexpected alliances. Shall we make our way into Dravania, then? The chill of the western highlands is unrelenting, and I would sooner be under the sheltering canopy of the Chocobo Forest.

Alphinaud

-- This forest was mentioned in the pages of the New Eorzean Geographic. As I recall, the author advised travelers to give the local chocobos a wide berth. According to her, they can be remarkably aggressive...

Ysayle

-- We now stand on the threshold of Dravania. The path to Sohm Al will take us far to the west, beyond the embrace of the forest's branches. It will be a long and demanding journey. Might I suggest that we take our rest at the village up ahead, and see that we are properly provisioned?

Alphinaud

-- There is a village here? But I thought these lands the sole domain of dragonkind. Why would anyone choose to live in so perilous a place?

Ysayle

-- The wild chocobos. Tailfeather was built by hunters who make their living capturing and selling the beasts. Their leader, Marcechamp, is an acquaintance of mine. Being a gregarious sort, he will no doubt welcome our arrival. And he will also possess more recent knowledge of the road we seek to travel. I trust there are no objections?

Estinien

Ysayle

-- That it has, Marcechamp. That it has. My companions and I are on a pilgrimage to Sohm Al. Might we stay in Tailfeather awhile, and prepare for the next leg of our journey?

Marcechamp

-- Of course, of course, stay as long as you like! In fact, I wouldn't suggest leavin' the forest at all. The dragons've been absolutely bleedin' murderous of late.

Alphinaud

-- Forgive me, sir, but I am not sure I understand. Do the dragons not bother you here in the forest?

Marcechamp

-- Bother us? Did Ysayle not explain things to you, boy? You've seen them towerin' caelumtrees all about, haven't you? If you were flyin' above the canopy, you'd barely be able to see the ground. An' as you'd expect, the local wildlife's canny enough to stay hidden beneath the leaves--which is why the dragons do their huntin' elsewhere, an' we can do ours in peace.

Alphinaud

-- ...I see. Thank you for the explanation.

Marcechamp

-- You're welcome. Now, I know it won't stop Ysayle here, but dragons ain't the only things you'll need to keep an eye out for. Especially if you're set on headin' west...

Betraying unexpected warmth, Lady Iceheart invites you to use her true name, Ysayle, before confessing her bewilderment at the unlikely alliances that fate is wont to forge. Follow her and your fellows to the west, and enter the Dravanian forelands.

You have left the snowy fields of Coerthas behind you, and set foot on Dravanian soil. Inquire of Ysayle how you are to proceed.

After a brief discussion, it is decided that the party will stop at a nearby village to rest and make inquiries before pushing on towards Sohm Al. Speak with Marcechamp at Tailfeather to hear what the road ahead might hold in store.

Marcechamp welcomes you to Tailfeather. Upon learning of your intention to press on to Sohm Al, the leader of the hunters declares that dragons are not the only dangers that await you to the west...

## Worse than Dragons

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Marcechamp would give you fair warning about what awaits to the west.

Estinien

-- These hunters scrabble in the shadow of dragons for naught but the love of coin. Greed inspires courage and madness in equal measure, it seems.

Alphinaud

-- I have read widely of the world and its wonders, yet after taking but a few steps into the unknown, I am reminded how much I have still to discover.

Marcechamp

-- I daresay you're wonderin' what could possibly be worse than dragons, eh? Well, I'll tell you: the bloody Gnath. They're what you might get if you crossed an antling with a megalocrab an' taught the thing how to walk on two legs. They never used to stray far from their hives out of fear of the dragons, but they've gotten a lot more aggressive of late, sendin' out war parties for malms in all directions. They've even taken to harassin' the Dravanians in their own lairs, if you can believe it. An' when they venture into the forest--which is more an' more, by the way--they certainly ain't afraid to come after my lot. I can only imagine how much worse it'd be closer to the Gnath's home territory... Now listen here, lass: if you're set on headin' west, you'd best keep your ears peeled for the angry clicks of Gnath mandibles, or you'll find yourself staring into a set.

Ysayle

-- 'Twould seem that much has changed in Dravania. The Gnath were not wont to cause such strife when I lived here.

Alphinaud

-- You lived here? In Dravania?

Ysayle

-- Aye, 'twas in the time following the Calamity. My family was dead, my home was gone, and I had fled from the bitter cold into these lands. I knew not the paths of the forest then, and wandered out from under the protection of its boughs. That was when I chanced upon Hraesvelgr. He had descended from his mountain lair to hunt for food. My exhausted mind could not contend with the sight of the majestic wyrm--nor the vision of the past his presence visited upon me. Thankfully, Marcechamp found my unconscious form at the edge of the trees, and nursed me back to health. And in Tailfeather I remained for some time.

Alphinaud

-- ...Hence your familiarity with the locals. But I interrupted you--you were saying these Gnath were once a peaceful people?

Ysayle

-- “Peaceful” would not be the most fitting description. They are a fiercely territorial tribe, and any who intrude upon their domain are attacked without hesitation or quarter. Outside the borders of their homeland, however, they were rarely hostile. Indeed, we were even able to trade with them on occasion.

Estinien

-- They have changed, then. What of it? We have not the time to creep through the underbrush on some roundabout route. I say we make straight for Sohm Al and crush any unruly insect we meet underfoot.

Ysayle

-- A more direct path, then. Very well. Let us first follow the trail west out of the forest, and make for the statue of the Stained One. From there, we should have a fair view of the road that leads to Sohm Al. Shall we...?

Alphinaud

-- Should we chance to meet Marcechamp again, remind me to thank him. Had he not warned us to expect the Gnath, I doubt I would be standing here. ...Amid ruins that I would tentatively describe as Ishgardian...? The style, if not quite identical, betrays a definite resemblance...

Ysayle

-- You have a scholar's eye, Master Alphinaud. This structure is, in fact, over a thousand years old. It is a remnant of the age when our ancestors and dragonkind lived together in peace.

Estinien

-- Hmph. You claim this as evidence of our harmonious past? I was taught that these buildings were constructed by heretics, in honor of your Dravanian masters. This rubble inspires no such awe in me...

Ysayle

-- Stubborn fool. How desperately you cling to the false teachings of your beloved Holy See!

Alphinaud

-- Enough! Both of you! You threaten the success of our mission with this incessant squabbling! Luna, pray reason with these two.

-- ...Gods above, even Luna has lost patience with you. We have a common goal. Lest you forget, our goal is to prevent a war which will claim the lives of Dravanians and Ishgardians alike. If we are to accomplish this, you must learn to tolerate each other's presence. Trust in Luna's gift--in time, the secrets of history will be brought to light. Let that be enough, Estinien. You would have me keep my counsel until Luna's visions confirm the truth? Very well. But bait me not.

Iceheart

-- Our meeting with Hraesvelgr will likely provide the catalyst Luna's gift requires--as it did mine. Let us press on.

Estinien

-- These antmen are bold to bring their war to the dragons' doorstep. Mayhap we should invite them to man the walls of Ishgard...

Alphinaud

-- Dragons in the sky, and Gnath upon the ground... One must needs sprout eyes in the back of one's head to survive this land!

Marcechamp tells you of the beast tribe known as the Gnath, and of their recent acts of unprovoked hostility. According to the hunter, no one in the region--not even the mighty Dravanians--has been spared the insect--like people's aggression. Ask Ysayle how this development might affect your plans.

Ysayle recalls how she came to stay in the village of Tailfeather some years before, during which period the Gnath seemed a territorial but otherwise passive tribe. Unconcerned by the recent change in the beastmen's behavior, Estinien urges the party to cut a straight path through to Sohm Al. Follow the forest trail to the Stained One, and defeat any foes who stand in your way.

On the way to the Stained One, you are set upon by the Gnath, but soon give them cause to regret their choice of target. Press on towards your destination, eliminating any who seek to bar your path.

After advancing what feels like no more than a few yalms, you are set upon by another party of Gnath--who fare little better than their predecessors. Stay on the trail, and make for the Stained One where you are to rendezvous with Alphinaud and the others.

You arrive at the ruins, and are soon joined by the rest of your companions. When Ysayle claims that the site is a remnant of the age when her ancestors and the Dravanians lived in harmony, Estinien accuses her of peddling heretic falsehoods, prompting an exasperated Alphinaud to step in. After demanding that the pair set aside their differences for the good of the mission, he declares that their debate will presently be settled by the indisputable visions granted you by the Echo. Though you know that your gift is rarely so obliging, you say nothing. It is time to move on.
