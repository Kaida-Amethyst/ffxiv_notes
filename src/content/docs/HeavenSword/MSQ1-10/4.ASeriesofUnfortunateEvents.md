-- Honoroit is more than a little concerned for Lord Emmanellain's well-being.

Honoroit

-- Lord Emmanellain has been gone for an awfully long time. Did you perchance see him while you were searching for your crystal? Even he must realize the dangers of wandering too far in such a place... Mayhap I am worrying about nothing, but...I must ask that you assist me in looking for him, Mistress Kali. We shall find him more quickly if we split up. Pray search the southeastern area of Voor Sian Siran as swiftly as you are able and rendezvous with me in the north. Farewell, and good luck.

System

-- You survey the surrounding area for a time, but see no sign of Emmanellain.

Honoroit

-- M-Mistress Kali! Lord Emmanellain...Lord Emmanellain has been taken by the Vanu! They had my lord surrounded─a whole gang of them! Please, you must come quickly!

-- The Vanu must have taken him to that village, mayhap to present to their chieftain... I-I will make haste to the Rosehouse and tell Lady Laniaitte what has happened. Yet... Yet by the time I return with aid, i-it may already be too late... Forgive me for asking, Mistress Kali, but should you spy an opportunity to sneak past the sentries and rescue Lord Emmanellain in my absence, I beg you to take it!

-- I know he can be a trifle presumptuous...and insensitive...and, well...insufferable─but he doesn't deserve this!

Emmanellain the Lofty: By the Fury, you're...you're not going to eat me, are you? That's not what you do to prisoners, is it!?
Emmanellain the Lofty: Luna! Luna! I'm over here!
Chief Honu Vanu: Netherlings come to free prisoner! Spread word like thunder, and cast them into cloud sea!
Chief Honu Vanu: Netherlings slink away like guileful gaelicats! Rally, warriors of Gundu! Let none escape!
Haurchefant of the Silver Fuller: Help has arrived, Luna!
Emmanellain the Lofty: Haurchefant, is that you!? Thank heavens! Get us out of here!

-- The White! The White! Mighty Bismarck, Lord of the Mists!

Haurchefant

-- A flying whale!? By the Fury, i-it's a primal!

-- We must away!

Cid

-- Damn! Bloody typical... All right─we're going in!

Biggs and Wedge

Cid

Haurchefant

Emmanellain

Cid

-- The gods only know what might've happened had we not been around to save you... No need for thanks, though. It's not as if you haven't done the same for us on a few previous occasions. All right, more than a few.

-- 'Twas but blind chance that brought us together this time, in case you were wondering. The Holy See has petitioned the Ironworks for assistance with this creation of theirs, the Protector. Apparently, they just can't seem to get her flying. Anyway, I came to Camp Cloudtop to cast an eye over the ship, only to learn that you had arrived some few days before with an Ishgardian lordling in tow. "Small world!“ I thought─just as said lordling's manservant skittered into view, babbling about his master having been captured and you risking all to rescue him. And the rest, as they say, is history.

-- Right, well, I hate to cut short our reunion, but I am here on business after all, and the boys are already hard at work. Don't worry, old friend─we'll speak again soon, I promise.

Worried that something may have happened to Lord Emmanellain, Honoroit asks you to help him search Voor Sian Siran for his master. Return to the floating lakes and look for any sign of the young lord.

You survey the surrounding area for a time, but see no sign of Emmanellain. Rendezvous with Honoroit and see if he has had better luck.

Flustered and breathless, his eyes wide with terror, Honoroit screams that Lord Emmanellain has been captured by the Vanu Vanu. Follow the manservant and find out what has become of his lord.

It quickly becomes clear that Lord Emmanellain has been taken to a nearby Vanu stronghold. Fearing the worst, Honoroit begs you to rescue his master before departing for Camp Cloudtop to seek help. Under cover of darkness, you attempt to free the young lord, and succeed with the aid of Haurchefant, who arrives in the nick of time with a party of knights. However, the Vanu are too numerous, and you soon find yourselves surrounded with no means of escape.

The chieftain of the Vanu then cries out to the heavens, and a gargantuan flying whale appears to answer his call. Bismarck, Lord of the Mists, the chieftain names it, and Haurchefant realizes with horror that the creature is a primal. Fortunately, before the monster can swallow you whole, Cid Garlond swoops down aboard the Enterprise and spirits you away.

It would seem that Cid's perfectly timed rescue was a product of happy coincidence, as he had come to Camp Cloudtop to inspect the Protector. So it was that he happened to be present when Honoroit returned from Voor Sian Siran, begging for assistance. Having ensured your safety, he confirms his intent to return to his work on the Ishgardian airship, but promises that you will speak again soon.

# A Reward Long in Coming

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Lord Emmanellain appears to be rather pleased with himself.

Emmanellain

-- Very well, I admit it: it was an incredibly harrowing experience. I could very well have died, you know! Me! Dead! On the other hand, by risking life and limb in the line of duty, I did succeed in uncovering the existence of a new primal. And that, old girl, is no small feat! I have made an historic discovery─a fact even Lady Laniaitte will have no choice but to acknowledge! Yeeesss, I am rather looking forward to basking in the sunshine of her praise. Speaking of which─isn't it time we made our triumphant return?

-- How do I look? Dashing as always, with a suitable sprinkling of dirt and sweat? Excellent. Let us return to Lady Laniaitte at once!

Haurchefant

-- Even after everything he has been through, he manages to remain so...optimistic.

Laniaitte

-- Praise Halone, I feared the worst! What happened out there?

-- A primal!? Are you sure!?

-- Yet...now that I think on it, this Bismarck is reminiscent of the white whale of Vanu legend─a massive creature said to “swim” in the Sea of Clouds.

Haurchefant

-- From what I have learned of comparable summonings, the presence of the Vanu's god would certainly explain the sudden change in their behavior toward the people of Camp Cloudtop.

Honoroit

-- Ah, you mean to say that they have fallen under the primal's influence? I recall reading of such things in the documents provided by Master Alphinaud...

Emmanellain

-- Aren't we forgetting something important, Lady Laniaitte? A little recognition for the hero of the hour? A few choice expressions of gratitude, respect, admiration, and so on...?

Laniaitte

-- ...Why yes. You are right, of course. Mistress Kali deserves all that and more for having risked her life to rescue such an...esteemed personage.

Haurchefant

-- Well, if there is naught else to discuss, I would depart for Ishgard forthwith. The Holy See and the Temple Knights must be informed of this new threat without delay.

Laniaitte

-- But of course. Mistress Kali, you have done more than enough here. Pray return to Ishgard with Lord Haurchefant and give my warmest regards to the count.

Emmanellain

-- So that's it, then? No more forays into enemy territory? Very well, I can see my services are no longer needed. Take care, Lady Laniaitte. May our next meeting take place under more...felicitous circumstances.

Haurchefant

-- All's well that ends well, eh? To the airship landing, then! We can speak on the journey home.

Laniaitte

-- All things considered, Emmanellain came through relatively unscathed. More's the pity─he might have learned something otherwise.

Haurchefant

-- I confess, I have always been rather fond of airship travel. The chill of the wind upon your face, the warmth of the blood pumping in your veins from the excitement...! I find the whole experience indescribably invigorating! Or mayhap it is simply the joy of having cheated death yet again!? Ha ha! In any event, I must make for the Congregation and inform Ser Aymeric of all that has occurred.

-- Emmanellain should have returned to the manor by now. Why not go and see if he has recovered from his ordeal?

Honoroit

-- (My lord the count was utterly beside himself, Mistress Kali. 'Tis a mercy you were not here to witness it.)

Emmanellain

-- Oh, it's you, Luna...<whimper> Gods, did he have to strike me so hard?

-- Father, he ... he did not approve of how I handled matters in Camp Cloudtop--how I endangered the lives of others through my own...<sniff>...recklessness and incompetence. It's not easy playing the hero, is it...

```plaintext
Ever quick to see the glass half-full, Lord Emmanellain has convinced himself that he should rightly be lauded for uncovering the existence of a Vanu primal. Report to Lady Laniaitte and see if she agrees.

Lady Laniaitte is shocked to hear that the Vanu have summoned a primal, and all agree that its presence must be behind the recent rise in Vanu hostility. Sensing his moment, Lord Emmanellain rather bluntly demands that the true hero of the hour be recognized, and for once, Lady Laniaitte agrees...and praises you for rescuing the young lord from a doom of his own making. More than satisfied with your efforts, she then invites you to return to Ishgard with Lord Haurchefant, prompting Lord Emmanellain to conclude that he too is no longer needed. Make your journey back to the city and speak with Lord Haurchefant once you have arrived.

Lord Haurchefant is a man who knows how to appreciate the simple pleasures in life, particularly after cheating death in battle yet again. In spite of this, he cannot help but be concerned for the welfare of Lord Emmanellain, and suggests that you visit him back at the manor.

For once, Lord Emmanellain is not his effervescent self, having received a dressing-down from his father for his recklessness. But will he take this lesson to heart? Only time will tell...

-- The Fortemps steward looks as though he has something to say.

House Fortemps Steward

-- Ah, Mistress Kali. My lord the count much desires to speak with you regarding your time with Lord Artoirel and Lord Emmanellain. If you would remain here for a moment...

Count Edmnt de Fortemps

-- The hero returns! I cannot thank you enough for saving young Emmanellain's life. Aye, aye─he told me everything. I've also received letters from both House Dzemael and Durendaire praising your conduct--and that of House Fortemps. You've won us much honor, my friend.

House Fortemps Steward

-- My lord!

Count Edmnt de Fortemps

-- What is it? Speak.

House Fortemps Steward

-- Pray forgive the intrusion, my lord, but I-I bring grave tidings!  Master Alphinaud and Mistress Tataru have been detained on suspicion of fomenting heresy!

Count Edmnt de Fortemps

-- What? Explain!

House Fortemps Steward

-- They...they were observed entering a tavern in the lower levels on some half-dozen occasions. There, it is claimed, they made a number of inquiries...Inquiries which brought them into contact with certain...ahem...elements. 'Twas this which prompted a knight of the Heavens' Ward to demand that they be questioned. Ser Grinnaux, my lord...

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- Ser Grinnaux is a brute─an exceedingly accomplished brute, but a brute nonetheless. Alas, he is also a son of House Dzemael.

-- How quickly we forget the petty nature of men. I'd wager your friends are no more than pawns in another of my countrymen's games. Such is the way of things between the High Houses...

House Fortemps Steward

-- Their Status as wards of House Fortemps should afford them preferential treatment--for a time, at least.

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- Though you have won the hearts and minds of many of my countrymen, there are those who will never be swayed. Men who will dismiss your efforts and resent your successes, even as we celebrate them. 'Tis like that one such member of House Dzemael is manipulating Ser Grinnaux, for he is not a man to dabble in politics of his own volition. He may genuinely believe your friends to be guilty, though I am quite certain his masters know better. Yet the truth will avail us naught if we cannot prove their innocence. You would do well to speak with Ser Aymeric at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly. He will know more of these charges.

-- I know as little as you do of the situation, Mistress Kali. Ser Aymeric, however, will surely know more.

Lucia

-- That they should regard the Scions with such suspicion even after you stood with us on the Steps of Faith... It is bad comedy. Yet unlike the grave injustice you suffered in Ul'dah, this wrong may swiftly be righted.

Haurchefant

-- Luna! I had but this moment resolved to go and fetch you! I presume you have heard what happened, then...

Aymeric

-- It has been too long, Luna. Would that this visit came under happier circumstances. You are come to plead for Master Alphinaud and Mistress Tataru, I take it?

Hauchefant

-- Word of their detainment reached us while I was delivering my report on the Vanu primal. Truly, I know not which is the more ludicrous─these charges or that flying feathered whale!

Aymeric

-- That Ser Grinnaux's accusations are baseless, I have no doubt. Refuting them will be difficult, however, as he is a knight of the Heavens' Ward.

-- I speak of the personal guard of the archbishop─the twelve finest knights in all of Ishgard, sworn to serve His Eminence alone. Suffice it to say, their testimony is unimpeachable, and I have not the authority to challenge their actions.

Hauchefant

-- After all the Scions have done─routing the heretics and defeating Shiva, helping us to defend the Steps of Faith and drive back the Dravanian Horde─after proving themselves true allies on countless occasions, is there naught we can do!?

Aymeric

-- I fear there is but one path left to us... We must demand a trial by combat.

Hauchefant

-- But of course!

Hauchefant

-- In a trial by combat sanctioned by the inquisition, the victor's claim is judged true regardless of the petitioner's standing!

Aymeric

-- Under Ishgardian law, a trial by combat pits the accuser against the accused. In this instance, Master Alphinaud and Mistress Tataru would be expected to face Ser Grinnaux and a second of his choosing--another knight of the Heavens' Ward, most like.

Hauchefant

-- Two of them!? By the Fury, that can hardly be considered fair...

Aymeric

-- Master Alphinaud's magical talents will not have gone unnoticed, meaning that he will have no choice but to participate. Mistress Tataru, on the other hand, is quite obviously bereft of martial skill, and should be afforded the right to name a champion to fight in her stead. Lest you doubt, I am ready and willing to serve in this capacity, as I am sure is Lord Haurchefant...but all here present know that you are the most accomplished warrior among us, and mayhap in the realm at large...

Hauchefant

-- Then it is settled! I will visit Master Alphinaud at once, and inform him of our intentions. Luna--meet me at the Tribunal when you have made ready. Until then, my friend!

Aymeric

-- The trial will be held at the Supreme Sacred Tribunal of Halonic Inquisitory Doctrine. I will be in attendance, as will many others with a vested interest in the outcome. Stint not in your preparations, my friend. The knights of the Heavens' Ward will provide a stern test for even one such as you.

Hauchefant

-- Listen carefully, Luna. When the trial begins, the petitioner will be asked to restate his charges, and the accused invited to respond. Then, in accordance with the law, they will be asked to restate their request for a trial by combat. Once the high adjudicator acknowledges Mistress Tataru's right to name a champion, that is when you must make your entrance! Ohhh, I cannot wait to see the look on Ser Grinnaux's face when he sees his true opponent! 'Twill be priceless! More seriously...should you begin to lose heart, look to me in the stands, and I shall cheer so loud, you will wonder how you could ever have contrived to doubt yourself! Now, are you ready?

High Adjudicator

-- We are gathered here today, under the watchful gaze of the Fury, to ascertain the guilt of two souls in a trial by combat! Petitioners, step forward!

-- Ser Grinnaux--for the benefit of all here present, I would ask you to repeat the charges which you have leveled against this man and this woman.

Grinnaux

-- I, Ser Grinnaux de Dzemael, brother of the Heavens' Ward, did bear witness to these two foreigners consorting with heretics!

High Adjudicator

-- Let the accused step forward!

-- Alphinaud Leveilleur, Tataru Taru─you have heard the charges leveled against you. Will you take up arms to refute Ser Grinnaux's claim and thereby prove your innocence in the eyes of gods and men?

Alphinaud

-- I, Alphinaud Leveilleur, am innocent of this charge, and claim my right to trial by combat!

Tataru

-- I, Tataru Taru, am innocent of this charge... But I am no warrior, and cannot fight, so I claim the right to name a champion!

High Adjudicator

-- To the old and the infirm, the young and the weak, this right we allow. Very well. Who will stand for this woman?

Alphinaud

-- Just as I was beginning to doubt the efficacy of the Ishgardian justice system! Come, my friend--let us put an end to this mummer's farce!

High Adjudicator

-- O Halone, render unto us Your judgment! Raise up the righteous, and cast down the wicked!

Tataru

-- Th-They... I mean, WE WON!

High Adjudicator

-- The Fury has spoken! Alphinaud Leveilleur, Tataru Taru─you are hereby acquitted of all charges. Blessed are we who receive of Her wisdom and see justice wrought by Her divine hand! Petitioners, accused─go forth in peace!

Alphinaud

-- Delivered from an untimely demise yet again. My thanks...as always.

Hauchefant

-- By the Fury, what a splendid victory! To see how you strove in the face of adversity─two brave young souls bound together by the puissant bonds of camaraderie...! Why, it stirred me to the very depths of my soul!

-- Having been treated to such a rousing spectacle, it seems only right that I present you with a humble token of mine admiration. Pray receive of me this chocobo whistle. With it, you may summon a black chocobo─fully trained and ready to fly!

-- Magnificent, is she not? Strong yet sleek, elegant yet eager! What say you, Luna--will you take her for your steed?

Guard

-- Lord Haurchefant! Chocobos are prohibited in the Supreme Sacred Tribunal of Halonic Inquisitory Doctrine! Your steed must remain outside!

System

-- You have obtained a black chocobo! When riding this mount, you will have the ability to fly, provided certain conditions have been met. To fly in a given region, you must first find and attune to all the local aether currents. In order to attune to some aether currents, you will need to complete certain quests. However, most can be discovered via exploration. To aid you in this endeavor, you have also obtained an aether compass, which will provide you with both the bearing and the distance to the nearest aether current upon use.

Having been informed of all you accomplished during your time in Falcon's Nest and Camp Cloudtop, Count Edmont wishes to express his heartfelt gratitude. He has scarce begun to speak, however, when his steward bursts in, bearing grave tidings: Alphinaud and Tataru have been arrested by a knight of the Heavens' Ward─one “Ser Grinnaux”─on the charge of fomenting heresy. Ask the count for his counsel.

The count believes the charges leveled against your friends to be nothing more than a political ploy to defame House Fortemps. Regardless, you have no choice but to disprove them if you are to set Alphinaud and Tataru free. Reasoning that Ser Aymeric will know the exact nature of the allegations, Edmont advises you to pay the lord commander a visit at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly.

Though Ser Aymeric believes your friends to be innocent, he is powerless to intervene as the knight who accused them is a member of the Heavens' Ward─the personal guard of the archbishop. These twelve chosen sers answer to none save the archbishop himself, and their testimony is unimpeachable. As such, under Ishgardian law, only the Fury Herself can disprove Ser Grinnaux's claims...by granting victory in a trial by combat between the accuser and the accused. Owing to his magical talents, Alphinaud must fight, but Tataru may claim the right to name a champion. And who else but the Warrior of Light could stand against the might of the Heavens' Ward? Make your preparations and speak to Lord Haurchefant in the Supreme Sacred Tribunal of Halonic Inquisitory Doctrine when you are ready to face the knights in battle.

Under the watchful gaze of the Fury, and the assembled gentry of Ishgard, you defeat Ser Grinnaux and Ser Paulecrain, thus earning your comrades their freedom. Afterwards, you find Lord Haurchefant waiting for you. See what he has to say.

Still giddy with excitement, Lord Haurchefant presents you with a gift to commemorate your victory: a fully trained black chocobo, much like the one that bore you to the western highlands─strong, obedient, and blessed with the power of flight! No longer will you be confined to the earth. Henceforth, the sky is the limit!

-- Lord Haurchefant thinks you could do with a well-deserved rest.

Hauchefant

-- Black chocobos are all well and good, but the true reward for your efforts is the exoneration of your comrades. They shall be released upon the completion of certain minor formalities, which I mean to see to personally. In the meantime, pray return to Fortemps Manor. The count has done so already, and will doubtless be eager to discuss the day's events.

-- Rest assured that Master Alphinaud and Mistress Tataru are no longer in danger. They will join you at the manor anon.

Artoirel

-- I was not present at the trial, but my father told me of your performance. He said you were a wonder to behold!

Emmanellain

-- Are you trying to become the talk of the city? Because if you are, you're doing an admirable job of it.

Aymeric

-- Your Eminence, it is my honor to present to you the Warrior of Light.

Archbishop Thordan VII

-- I have heard the tales of your many grand endeavors. The lord commander has also been most effusive in his praise. I am Thordan VII, Archbishop of the Ishgardian Orthodox Church, and I bade you come here that I might offer my personal apologies. You will forgive me for not calling upon you as courtesy would dictate, but as you can see, my more sprightly days are long behind me. But I digress. Your companions were wrongly accused of heresy and subjected to gross indignities. This, I am sorry to say, was the result of negligence on the part of our nation's protectors--negligence born of an excess of zeal. Is that not so, Ser Zephirin?

Zephirin

-- Yes, Your Eminence...Regrettably, it would appear that we of the Heavens' Ward in receipt of erroneous information. Ser Grinnaux has ever been headstrong. He pressed charges before the truth had been ascertained, for which I most sincerely apologize.

Archbishop Thordan VII

-- An unfortunate misunderstanding born of an earnest desire to serve Ishgard--but one which should never have occurred... For who could doubt the character of those who bested Shiva and drove the Horde from the Steps of Faith? Not I, that much is certain.

-- That will be all, Ser Zephirin. I would speak with our guest in private.

Zephirin

-- Your Eminence?! I...

-- As you wish, Your Eminence. That will be all for today.

Archbishop Thordan VII

-- Privacy is a luxury rarely afforded one in my position.

-- Now, tell me, young lady: what do you know of the Ascians?

-- Much and more, I shouldn't wonder, being the Bringer of Light. You should know that I myself have met with them--have entertained them as guests, even.

-- Those harbingers of chaos and strife offered us power, that we might continue our war against the dragons. I have no intention of aiding their cause, of course, nor less of being their puppet. Yet were I to refuse them outright, I should learn naught of their true objectives and remain powerless to stop them. Thus have I hearkened to their words with interest, and paid lip service to their beliefs, biding my time and preparing for the inevitable conflict.

-- And why do I tell you this? Because there is naught in this world they fear more than the power of the Warrior of Light. If we are to rid ourselves of these vile interlopers, we must need work together. With our combined strength, I have faith that we can wrest Eorzea from their grasp, and pave the way for a lasting peace. Think on it.

Tataru

-- I nearly cried when you stepped forward at the Tribunal, Luna! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Alphinaud

-- There you are. I confess, I was more than a little concerned when I learned that you had been summoned to the Vault. What did they want with you?

-- Well, well. A formal apology and an admonishment of those responsible!? I see my fears were wholly misplaced.

-- By the gods, the archbishop freely admits to consorting with Ascians? So their ambitions extend to Ishgard as well...

-- We will have new primals to contend with ere long, of that you may be certain. 'Tis but a matter of time. Yet shorn of the support of our missing allies, what can we realistically hope to achieve.

Tataru

-- Ahhh! In the midst of all the excitement, I completely forgot to tell you! When I was asking around about the Scions, I heard the most awful rumor! General Raubahn is to be executed for crimes against the sultanate!

Alphinaud

-- If the Flame General dies, we will lose a staunch ally, and the one man capable of holding the sultana's assassins to account. Lord Haurchefant was wise to counsel restraint, but this business will brook no delay.

-- We cannot permit this execution to take place. We must save Raubahn!

Although the trial is ended, Lord Haurchefant must attend to some minor formalities before Alphinaud and Tataru can be released. In the meantime, he suggests that you return to the manor, and discuss the day's events with Count Edmont.

As usual, your conversation with the count is cut short, this time by the arrival of a message from the Vault. It would seem that His Eminence Archbishop Thordan VII has requested your presence. Hasten to the Holy Vault and speak with the priest outside the entrance to be granted admission.

Thordan VII warmly welcomes you and apologizes for the misunderstanding that led to Alphinaud and Tataru's incarceration. Having taken the highly unusaul step of dismissing his personal guard, he then reveals to you that he has communicated with the Ascians, going on to explain that he is paying lip service to their wishes while plotting to move against them. He asks for your help in this endeavor, stating only by wresting Eorzea from their grasp can a lasting peace ever be forged. Return to Fortemps Manor and share this disturbing revelation with Alphinaud.

Alphinaud is shocked to learn that the Ascians' influence has also spread to Ishgard. Even as he ponders a course of action, Tataru remembers with a start a troubling rumor she had heard. It would seem that Raubahn is to be executed for crimes against the sultanate. Determined not to lose yet another ally, Alphinaud resolves to do everything in his power to rescue the deposed Flame General.
