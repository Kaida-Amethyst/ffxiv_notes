System Guide

-- Ysayle awaits an opportunity to surrender to the Gnath.

Ysayle

-- You are prepared, then? Hold here, Luna. When next the Gnath come, we offer no resistance.

Gnath soldiers

-- Surrender, intruders! There is no escape!

Ysayle

-- Enough! We surrender! We throw ourselves upon the mercy of your god!

-- They seem eager to proceed. Good. When they take us before their lord, pray leave matters to me. If what I know of summoning rituals holds true, I shall be well placed to act. ...Hmmm. Mark the sound of the river rushing through the ravine behind us. Passing loud, is it not? I imagine the noise would serve to mask our escape should we need to withdraw temporarily. But you are prepared, are you not? I do hope so. If I were to be dragged away for sacrifice while you were haggling over the price of potions, I should not be amused.

-- Though I dismissed Master Alphinaud's concerns, I confess that I did wonder how the Gnath might treat their prisoners. Happily, it would seem they are not wont to harm sacrifices─nor even to disarm them. Plainly, they imagine their god invulnerable. The plan goes better than expected...

Gnath drone

-- Try to escape and we will break your fleshy legs.

Ysayle

-- Now we have but to wait...

Gnath Priest

-- O Lord Ravana! Master of the Sacred Blades! Wrath of the Colony! Conqueror of the World! Hear our prayer! Pray grant unto Your devoted children the gift of Your divine presence!

Ysayle

-- He comes!

Ravana

-- All strength to the colony. Speak and I shall listen!

Gnath Priest

-- O Glorious General! We have captured intruders, and would make unto You an offering of their life's blood...

Ravana

-- These feeble fleshlings dared to invade Gnath lands?

Ysayle

-- Hear me, Lord Ravana! My companion and I did not come to contest your children's territory. We wished only to learn the reason you wage war against the dragons.

Ravana

-- Thou wouldst flirt with death merely to satisfy thy curiosity? Wherefore should the glorious conquests of the Gnath concern thee so, Elezen? ...Ahhh, mayhap thine own kind's struggle against the wyrms fareth poorly, and thou art desirous of a pact.

Ysayle

-- We crave no alliance, Lord Ravana--only peace. We would bring an end to our war with the dragons. Yet so long as they remain embroiled in this conflict with your children, our goal shall remain out of reach. Never before have the Gnath risen up in such numbers, and never yet with you at their head. Why do you lead them to war?

Ravana

-- Thy question hath no meaning. To live is but to fight. Long have my children waited, gathering their strength in the shadow of thy ceaseless conflict. The Gnath would see the Dravanians slain, and their territory secured--and by such fervent prayers am I now given form and purpose.

Ysayle

-- As I feared, your very existence is an obstacle to our goal. Since you are so fond of fighting, we challenge you, Lord of the Gnath! And should we emerge the victors, I would have you swear to withdraw your soldiers from Dravanian soil!

Ravana

-- Gahahaha! Thou art bold indeed to risk thy fleshy hide so readily! Very well. I, Ravana, fourfold master of the blade, do accept thy challenge! But should I emerge the victor, I would have thee swear to serve in mine army till thy last breath is spent! Do you accept!?

Ysayle

-- I do! And I believe the first bout is mine!

Ravana

-- What is this!? A god clad in flesh!?

Shiva

-- Is aught amiss, my lord? Thou wilt not break thy word, I trust.

Ravana

-- Mine oath is unbending as steel, little goddess! Thy ruse will but add to mine enjoyment!

Ysayle

-- I thought myself...stronger... Mayhap with more crystals...?

Ravana

-- Be thou god or maid, thou art nothing to me! ...And what of thee, mortal? Art thou warrior or craven? A warrior, then! Good! Mayhap thou wilt provide more sport than thy feeble companion!

Thok ast Thok (Hard) -- Description

An insectoid beast tribe connected by a hive mind, the Gnath have but one collective desire: to expand their territory and prosper without fear of dragons. It was by this simple yet powerful wish that a mighty primal bent on war and conquest was summoned into existence. Bound by your promise to Vidofnir to remove this threat to dragonkind, you must now lead your companions into battle against the savage entity known as Ravana, Lord of the Hive.

Ravana

-- Thus doth the sacred rite of combat proclaim the victor... I lay my blades at thy feet, child of man...

Ysayle

-- You do not disappoint, Warrior of Light. Would that I had your skill in battle. ...I do begin to see why so many place their faith in you. For all his savagery, I do not think Ravana one to break his word. Provided the dragons do not trespass upon Gnath lands, they should have little to fear of the primal's biting blades. We have done well, have we not? Come, let us return to Vidofnir and share these glad tidings.

Igeyorhm

-- Once more you achieve the impossible, Bringer of Light... But with every mortal heart that succumbs to fear and fury, another voice is joined to the chorus beseeching divine succor. At their bidding, warring gods will shake the firmament, and your world will be consumed in the swelling storm of chaos...

Ysayle

-- Never since we first fought have I seen you draw upon the full extent of your power...and never from afar till this day. You were a marvel to behold, Luna. Well...'tis time we rejoined our companions. They will be eager to hear the tale...and to continue our journey.

Estinien

-- The antmen's god is fallen, then? Impressive, Warrior of Light.

Alphinaud

-- Luna! Lady Ysayle! Thank the Twelve! ...“Lord Ravana,” you say? How curious that the Vath never mentioned his name... And you are quite certain he will keep his word?

Ysayle

-- There was honor beneath his savagery. That we survived the encounter at all was a miracle─a miracle I must attribute to Luna.

Estinien

-- Never did I doubt you, Warrior of Light...unlike some. You were gone so long that Master Alphinaud here nigh lost his wits with worry. Fretting like a maid for her sweetheart, he was!

Alphinaud

-- Estinien! Was that truly necessary!?

Estinien

-- Hahaha... Not truly necessary─but certainly true.

Alphinaud

-- Ahem! What matters is that the primal is banished, and our promise fulfilled. We should return to Vidofnir without delay. Lest you forget, this was but a means to secure an audience with the wyrm Hraesvelgr. Nidhogg's minions will not be halted by idle chatter! Come, now--we must make every moment count!

Ysayle

-- You are unkind, Estinien. For all his experience and intellect, Alphinaud is still but a boy.

Estinien

-- Ahh, you should have seen the boy fretting... 'Twas a sight to behold!

Ysayle

-- Tease him no more. Master Alphinaud is to be applauded for his sense of responsibility. Given his years, 'tis little wonder the burden weighs heavy upon his shoulders...

-- 'Tis natural for him to feel concern for his companions.

You have forced your way deep into the heart of Loth ast Gnath, provoking an ever more frenzied response from its many defenders. Satisfied with the chaos you have sown, Ysayle bids you offer no further resistance to the soldiers swarming about you. Surrender quietly, and allow the Gnath to take you prisoner.

The Gnath have taken you to a cave on the far side of the hive. Could this be where you will meet their mysterious deity? Enter the inner chamber, and see what manner of being awaits you.

You do not have to wait long before Lord Ravana, Master of the Sacred Blades and Wrath of the Colony, arrives to claim his sacrifices. Seizing the opportunity, Ysayle boldly questions the primal about his war with the dragons, before challenging him to a contest of might. Not one to shy away from a fight, Ravana accepts, and terms are duly agreed. If you prevail, the Gnath must cease hostilities with the Dravanians; but should Ravana emerge the victor, you will join his army as eternal thralls. Having goaded the primal into giving his word, Ysayle draws upon the energy of the Gnath's hoarded crystals to transform herself into Saint Shiva, and battle is joined. Even with Shiva's great strength, however, the heretic leader is no match for Ravana's flashing blades. As Ysayle sinks to her knees, defeated, the triumphant god's eyes alight on you. Take to the field and match your prowess against the self-proclaimed Conqueror of the World!

After a long and furious battle, Lord Ravana at last lays down his blades defeated. He duly proclaims you the victor by sacred rite of combat, and vows to call his followers back from the dragons' domain. Return now in triumph to the Dravanian forelands.

You return to the Dravanian forelands having added the name of yet another primal to the list of your defeated foes. Speak with Ysayle by the river outside of Loth ast Gnath.

Ysayle praises you for besting Ravana, while lamenting her own failure to test the primal. Sensing her despondence, you contemplate telling her that things might have been different had she not weakened your foe--only to realize that the moment has passed. Return to Loth ast Vath, and inform Alphinaud of your success.

Back at Loth ast Vath, you regale your companions with the tale of your victory over the Gnath's god. When Estinien subsequently reveals that your fellow Scion spent the hours leading up to your return “fretting like a maid for her sweetheart,” Alphinaud declares that you must press on with the mission--more, you sense, to escape the dragoon's mocking tongue than out of concern for Ishgard. He is, however, correct. Make your way back to Anyx Trine, and share news of your triumph with Vidofnir.

## Mourn in Passing🎧

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Alphinaud is keen to inform Vidofnir of Lord Ravana's defeat.

Alphinaud

-- Shall we be on our way to Anyx Trine, then? I would not have the dragons think that we have forgotten our bargain.

-- Vidofnir will be pleased to hear of Lord Ravana's defeat, and of his pledge to recall his soldiers.

Estinien

-- Will the dragon now honor her word? That remains to be seen...

Ysayle

-- You should be the one to break the news. The victory was yours, after all.

Vidofnir

-- Thou art returned, Little One. Hast thou abandoned thine ill-conceived contest with the Gnath?

Ysayle

-- Nay, my friend, we return in triumph. By Luna's hand was the beastmen's god, Lord Ravana, laid low. In his overconfidence, the primal swore to withdraw his followers from your lands in the event of his defeat─a promise we believe he will keep. The Gnath shall trouble you no longer.

Vidofnir

-- The deity is slain, then...? How didst thou contend with his biting blades!? ...But the particulars matter not. Thou hast fulfilled thy promise, and I shall fulfill mine. Attend me, mortals: hie you unto the deepest reaches of Mourn, and there shall you find Halo--the altar from which you may begin your ascent to the summit of Sohm Al. But be fairly warned: the minions of Nidhogg shall not lightly suffer your presence on that sacred mount. By your struggles within the cavern shall I judge your party possessed of sufficient fortitude to proceed.

Ysayle

-- We shall not disappoint you, Vidofnir. If memory serves, the cavern of Mourn is entered from the second floor of the central tower. Let us begin the climb.

Vidofnir

-- Well done, Little One. As promised, I shall open the way to Sohm Al's summit for thee and thy companions. Heed me now, children of man: the domain you seek to enter hath not seen visitors of your kind in nigh on a thousand years. Though I freely grant you passage, your presence will not be welcomed. To my kin, this mountain is revered as holy ground and resting place both--ware you the minions of Nidhogg during your ascent, for 'tis certain they shall take great offense at your intrusion.

Ysayle

-- We are grateful for your warnings, gentle Vidofnir.

Vidofnir

-- My final words are for thee, dragoon: have care to keep the stolen power thou wieldest in check, lest it breed further despair.

Estinien

-- The way is open. Let us not tarry here.

Ysayle

-- A moment! Shall we blindly forge on, knowing the dangers that await us? Tioman herself is said to guard this peak.

Estinien

-- I do not fear Nidhogg's consort. Any dragon foolish enough to bar our path shall feel the sting of my lance.

Ysayle

-- Spoken like a true butcher! Need I remind you that we are come to parley a peace!?

Estinien

-- Let us be clear, heretic: 'twas to save Ishgard and her people that I first lent my support to this doubtful venture. And 'tis for their sake that I go now to speak with Hraesvelgr. But I said nothing of Tioman. Should the opportunity present itself to rid my people of one of their deadliest enemies, I shall take it. That is my duty as Azure Dragoon.

Ysayle

-- You are beyond redemption...

Alphianud

-- We will accomplish nothing by bickering. If we are to meet with Hraesvelgr, our path leads up the mountain. We shall defend ourselves if attacked, but avoid conflict wherever possible. What other choice do we have?

Sohm AI -- Description

Sohm Al. Casting its shadow over the Dravanian forelands, this towering peak is revered by the dragons as both holy ground and resting place. And now, in accordance with your pact, Vidofnir has thrown open to you the final ascent to the sacred mount's summit. But Nidhogg's minions will not lightly suffer this intrusion. Ere you gaze upon the fabled expanse of the Churning Mists, you must first carve a path through the mountain's denizens and overcome the consort of Nidhogg, herself--the she-dragon, Tioman.

Alphinaud

Ysayle

-- How can one not be moved by such a breathtaking sight...

Alphinaud is eager to begin the ascent of Sohm Al. Return to Anyx Trine in the Dravanian forelands, and report your victory over the Gnath's god to Vidofnir.

Vidofnir listens in disbelief as Ysayle relates the circumstances of Lord Ravana's defeat. True to her word, the dragon vows that she will open the way to Sohm Al...once you have negotiated the cavern of Mourn. Climb the central tower of Anyx Trine to the second floor, then fight your way through Mourn's denizens to join Vidofnir on the threshold of the path to the summit.

After battling your way through the cavern of Mourn, Vidofnir opens the path forward, as promised. Before taking her leave, however, the dragon warns that you will not be welcome in the domain beyond. Prepare to face the mightiest of Nidhogg's minions, on your way to the summit of Sohm Al.

You have defeated Tioman, the consort of Nidhogg, and restored light to your Crystal of Earth in so doing. Soon after the dragon's death, however, Estinien is overwhelmed by Nidhogg's feelings of rage and anguish--an unwelcome reminder of the connection he shares with the great wyrm. Put any doubts you may feel to one side, and continue your journey into the Churning Mists.

You have arrived at the summit of Sohm Al. Trouble Alphinaud for his thoughts on finally having reached the mountain's lofty peak.

Alphinaud seems awed and humbled to be standing at the summit of Eorzea's highest mountain. The Churning Mists stretch out before you, beckoning you on towards the culmination of your arduous journey.

-- Alphinaud ponders the means by which you might find Hraesvelgr.

Alphinaud

-- Now that we have scaled the mountain, there remains the problem of finding Hraesvelgr himself...

Ysayle

-- What manner of creature is that...?

Alphinaud

-- Do my eyes deceive me, or was that a moogle? It was my understanding that they only dwelled within the Twelveswood. I certainly never expected to see one in the Churning Mists... If the moogle does live here, however, he may know where Hraesvelgr makes his lair. Quickly, now, before we lose the creature completely!

-- Bah, he's gone! Luna, we must widen our search.

Estinien

-- A “moogle,” did you say? I am unfamiliar with the breed, but I shall search for one nonetheless...

-- I see no evidence of this moogle of yours. Are you certain it wasn't a trick of the light? Mayhaps 'twas simply one of these strange plants, shifting in a breeze...

Ysayle

-- I have heard tales of these moogles, but 'tis the first time I've ever laid eyes on one. They are rather adorable, aren't they?

-- What--Why do you stare at me so? Can I not find a creature adorable? My heart is not truly made of ice...

System Guide

As Alphinaud muses on how the party can best locate Hraesvelgr, Ysayle exclaims in surprise at the sight of a moogle.

Speak with Alphinaud, and learn if he has spotted your hopefully informative quarry.

You have lost sight of the moogle. Survey the area, and attempt to catch a glimpse of the frightened creature.

You scan the area, but can find no sign of the elusive moogle. Return to Alphinaud, and report your failure.

## Mountaintop Diplomacy

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Alphinaud seems convinced that the moogles hold the key to finding Hraesvelgr.

Alphinaud

-- Confound it. Could we but enlist the aid of one of the local moogles, I am certain Hraesvelgr would not elude us for long...

Estinien

-- Though the Eye enables me to sense the presence of dragons, I can only identify Nidhogg's with any certainty. We could wander the Mists for days, and not know if we were any closer to his brood-brother...

Alphinaud

-- And those are days we cannot well afford to squander. Shall we divide our forces, then? Lady Ysayle--might I ask you to question any dragons whom you judge it safe to approach?

Ysayle

-- I shall try. Yet I fear the influence of Nidhogg's rage will render most of the Dravanians in the area deaf to reason. And what of you, Master Alphinaud?

Alphinaud

-- I have not yet given up on the moogles. Luna--come with me to Gridania. I mean to petition the aid of the moogles' kin in the Twelveswood. After that business with Moggle Mog, I daresay they will be glad to help us.

Estinien

-- Assuming you have no need of me, I shall remain here. Nidhogg senses both the loss of his consort and the coming of the Eye, and his attention is firmly fixed in this direction. I mean to do what I can to hold his gaze, in the hope that it might delay any action against Ishgard.

Alphinaud

-- Thank you, Estinien. Come then, Luna, let us make haste for Gridania, and rendezvous at Nophica's Altar. Ah, but I neglected to tell you... There is an aetheryte of ancient construction here which should make the return journey rather less arduous. Pray do not forget to use it!

Estinien

-- I sincerely hope you have taken Master Alphinaud's advice concerning the aetheryte. You would not wish to miss the sport if Nidhogg deigned to visit us in your absence.

<div class="border-4 p-6">
Alphinaud

-- I sent word to the Elder Seedseer upon arriving in Gridania, and I am pleased to report that she has agreed to grant us an audience. If anyone can help us to contact the Twelveswood moogles, it is she. We are expected at the Lotus Stand. I trust you are familiar with the conjurer stationed at its entrance?

-- The Elder Seedseer will receive us at the Lotus Stand. I trust you are familiar with the conjurer stationed at its entrance?

Kan-E-Senna

-- I bid you welcome, friends. The Admiral spoke of having met with you, but 'tis no less of a relief to see you safe and hale with mine own eyes.

Alphinaud

-- We humbly thank you for agreeing to receive us upon such short notice, my lady─and for all you have done for us in our absence. Would that it were solely to express our gratitude that we came to you this day... Alas, the tides of battle yet dictate our comings and goings. Elder Seedseer─we would beg your wisdom in a matter that may finally bring an end to the Dragonsong War.

Kan-E-Senna

-- Speak on, friend.

-- ...I see. So you seek a means to contact these moogles of the Churning Mists...

Kuplo Kopp

-- Kupopopo! I say, kupo!

Kan-E-Senna

-- Greetings, Kuplo Kopp. To what do we owe the pleasure of your company?

Kuplo Kopp

-- I was struck by the sudden urge to bring you some fruit, Kan-E-and I'm jolly glad I did! Tell me more about these moogles in the sky, kupo!

Alphinaud

-- I will gladly tell you all I know-though it amounts to precious little. We encountered a moogle high in the clouds of Dravania, and had hoped that you and your kin in the Twelveswood might agree to facilitate a meeting.

Kan-E-Senna

-- Pray correct me if I am mistaken, Kuplo, but there are legends, are there not, which speak of moogles who dwelled beyond the clouds?

Kuplo Kopp

-- Indeed there are, kupo! Long, long ago, back when the world was still young, they say my ancestors served the gods up in the heavens. Of course, that was before their masters took to bickering like spoiled children...

Kan-E-Senna

-- Ah, yes, the tale of Good King Moggle Mog XII. He is revered for holding fast to a rope of miraculous length, that his subjects might climb down from the sky and escape to the world below.

Alphinaud

-- Hmm... Ignoring the more fanciful aspects of the tale, it may well be that Kuplo's ancestors hailed from the Churning Mists. Given how long his kin have resided in the Twelveswood, it is perfectly possible that the details of their history have faded into myth...

Kan-E-Senna

-- Indeed, Master Alphinaud. Such stories oft contain a measure of truth. 'Tis like that the moogles of the Churning Mists tell similar tales of the world below... I can well imagine why the one you encountered fled at your approach.

Kuplo Kopp

-- Oh, fleeing's second nature to us! We often hide when the larger races come tramping through the forest. Of course, where there's one moogle, there's bound to be more...

-- ...Which is why I've decided to take a trip to the clouds, kupo! They surely won't be afraid to talk to me!

Alphinaud

-- I was hoping you might say that, Master Kuplo. You will accompany us, then?

Kuplo Kopp

-- Just you try and stop me, kupo! I'll admit, the thought of venturing outside the Twelveswood is a bit unsettling, but I can hardly refuse a chance to meet my distant, distant cousins!

Kan-E-Senna

-- If you will have me, I too will accompany you on this venture, and lend my voice to your cause as an ambassador of Gridania.

Alphinaud

-- M-My lady, I-- Are you quite certain?

Kan-E-Senna

-- How oft has our nation turned to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn in its hour of need? How oft have we asked the Warrior of Light to risk her life to save our own? Full many times, I say to you--and never have they refused us. Thus do I choose this day to offer mine aid to our allies for the good of the realm.

-- ...Is this not just?

Alphinaud

-- A most unexpected─and most welcome--offer, Elder Seedseer. We would be honored by your presence.

Ysayle

-- Ah, Luna, you are returned. How fared you in Gridania? Better than I, I hope... Hraesvelgr's whereabouts yet elude me.

-- Forgive me, Luna, but mine efforts have all been in vain. As I feared, Nidhogg's rage drives his minions to attack me on sight. And the few who did deign to speak fell silent at the name of Hraesvelgr. Wherefore, I cannot say, yet I fear it bodes ill.

Estinien

-- Well met, Warrior of Light. Nidhogg has not stirred, but he watches us, unblinking... ...Hm? The Elder Seedseer herself answers your call? Then there is naught to do but wait. They are here, Luna.

Alphinaud

-- Greetings, my friends. I am happy to report that our journey was mercifully uneventful, devoid as the road was of Dravanians. 'Twould seem the dragons have abandoned Sohm Al for the Churning Mists. Elder Seedseer, may I present to you Ser Estinien, Ishgard's Azure Dragoon.

Kan-E-Senna

-- 'Tis an honor to meet you, Ser Estinien. I have heard many tales of your order's extraordinary skill and courage.

-- Friends--I feel it only right to inform you that we are not alone. The moogles are all around us even as we speak. And I should imagine they are more than a little concerned by the horde of strangers that have descended upon their home. Mayhap now would be an opportune moment to introduce ourselves.

Kan-E-Senna

-- I am Kan-E-Senna. My companions and I have braved the long road from the Twelveswood to share words with you. On this, the occasion of our first meeting, we bring an offering of light and wind.

Moglin

-- Oooh, such a gentle and pleasing glow, kupo...

-- I am Moglin, the chieftain of this moogle clan.

Kan-E-Senna

-- Chieftain Moglin─it is an honor to meet you.

Kuplo Kopp

-- Greetings! I am Kuplo Kopp, ambassador of the Twelveswood moogles!

Moglin

-- ...A moogle from the world below? Your hide is of a different hue, but that pom is unmistakable! I might need a moment here, kupo...

Kan-E-Senna

-- My companions were no less surprised to learn of your existence here amongst the clouds. I hope they did not startle you overmuch in their eagerness to make your acquaintance. Full well can I imagine your wariness. I am told that men have not walked here in nigh on a thousand winters. Mayhap you will forgive them their forwardness when I unfold to you the grave matter which first brought them into your midst. My companions crave an audience with the great wyrm Hraesvelgr that they might negotiate an end to the war 'twixt man and dragon.

Moglin

-- An end to war, you say? Hmm... I trust you, Kan-E-Senna─the light of peace shines brightly within your soul. ...But I'm afraid the same cannot be said of your friends. To be plain, we did not hide ourselves because they were the first of your kind to be seen here in a thousand years--well, not only because of that. We hid because we smelled dragon blood. These skies are home to many, many dragons. While some crave peace, such as Hraesvelgr, many others crave the opposite...such as Nidhogg. Suffice it to say, we are worried that the presence of your blood-spattered warrior friends will attract the attention of the nastier kind, and invite destruction into our happy home.

Kuplo Kopp

-- Now just a moment, Chieftain! Luna here may have doled out the odd thrashing or two, but it's always been for a really good reason! She is a champion of the Twelveswood moogles, and I'll not hear her good name slandered!

Moglin

-- Now, now, Ambassador─let's not ruffle each other's fur. I shall of course take your testimony into consideration...

Kan-E-Senna

-- If I may, Chieftain: there is little room for trust 'twixt strangers. Might we not take this opportunity to learn more of each other?

Moglin

-- An excellent suggestion, kupo. In the interests of fostering friendship--and keeping an eye on you--I extend to you the hospitality of Moghome. Prove yourselves worthy of our assistance, and it will be yours. I shall be watching, kupo!

Unwilling to abandon his efforts to contact the moogles of the Churning Mists, Alphinaud resolves to seek the assistance of the furry creatures' Twelveswood kin. Travel to Gridania, and rendezvous with him at Nophica's Altar.

Upon arriving in Old Gridania, Alphinaud informs you that he has requested an audience with the Elder Seedseer. Provided you can secure Kan–E–Senna's assistance, you should have little difficulty contacting the moogles of the Twelveswood. Speak with the silent conjurer to gain access to the Lotus Stand.

After exchanging heartfelt greetings with the Elder Seedseer, Alphinaud explains the urgent nature of your visit. By good fortune, Kuplo Kopp overhears your conundrum, and pledges to accompany you back to the Churning Mists. To the surprise of all present, Kan–E–Senna then offers to do the same. Speak with Alphinaud at Nophica's Altar, and discuss arrangements for the return journey.

While Alphinaud escorts the Elder Seedseer and her entourage on the long road through Dravania, he asks that you return to Sohm Al's summit and inform your companions that help is on the way. Seek out Estinien in the deserted moogle settlement.

Thanks to the diplomacy of Kan–E–Senna--and the sight of Kuplo Kopp's familiar form--the moogles of the Churning Mists are persuaded to reveal themselves. Despite Kuplo Kopp's reassurances, however, the moogles' chieftain is not convinced that you will act in his people's best interests. Speak with Moglin, and begin the process of earning his trust.

It seems that Moglin has devised a number of trials by which he shall judge you worthy of his assistance. By the command of their chieftain, the moogles Moghan, Mogmug, and Mogwin stand ready to administer these mysterious tests...

## Mogwin's Trial

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Mogwin would test your trustworthiness with a trial.

Mogwin

-- Mogwin's the name, and art is my game. When it comes to painting, there are none in Moghome who can match my talent with a brush, kupo! I know why you have come--Chieftain Moglin has demanded that I test your trustworthiness. But as I trust no one to create art that will satisfy me, I instead charge you with retrieving a masterpiece I seem to have misplaced... It was an ambitious and innovative work-guaranteed to fetch at least four kupo nuts on the open market. You must find it! Question the masses! Surely a pebble painted with such vibrant color and unmistakable panache cannot have escaped the notice of every moogle in Moghome...

-- You must find my painted pebble, kupo! Art of this quality cannot be bought...for any less than four kupo nuts! Please, speak with my fellow moogles and track down my missing masterpiece!

Mogomo

-- Mogwin is missing his masterpiece, kupo? Oh, you mean that paint-smeared mess of a pebble? I've not seen it recently-a fact for which my eyes are profoundly grateful.

Muddled Moogle

-- Maestro Mogwin has misplaced his masterpiece, kupo!? Oh, happy day! If I am the swifter in finding it, I will soon have a genuine Mogwin for the price of a little perspiration! Honestly, who has four kupo nuts just lying about to spend on such luxuries...

Mogtoe

-- Hmmm. I don't know much about his stone, but I do know Mogwin's been creeping out the back way to Sohm Al's summit from time to time, kupo. Maybe he left it up there...

Mogwin

-- Well, what did you find out, kupo?  Ah. Ah, yes. Now that you mention it, I do seem to recall leaving my pebble out in the sun to dry... Ahem! The second part of your trial commences! Go, adventurer, and retrieve my masterpiece before some art-starved admirer swipes the stone for himself!

-- My pebble is somewhere out in the open on Sohm Al's summit. Retrieve it for me, and I shall put in a good word for you with the chieftain, kupo!

-- Do you have it, kupo? Is my masterpiece safe?

-- Yes, this is my work! Is it not exquisite? I call it Contemplations of Zenith. Thank you, madam! At last, I can exchange my art for those delectable kupo nuts! Chieftain Moglin will hear of this valorous deed!

<div class="border-4 p-6">
You speak with Mogwin, one of the three trial-givers named by Moglin, and the self-proclaimed artist bids you track down his missing masterpiece. Question the moogles of Moghome, and discern the whereabouts of the painted pebble.

You have spoken with the Moghome moogles, and received a variety of answers─some more helpful than others. It would seem that the forgetful artist has likely left his masterpiece out on Sohm Al's summit, and that the stone is in danger of being claimed by an enthusiastic devotee of his work. Return to Mogwin, and share the information you have learned.

Upon listening to the answers you received from his fellow moogles, Mogwin suddenly recalls that he deliberately left his painted pebble out in the sun to dry. Setting you upon the second half of your trial, the forgetful artist bids you rush outside and retrieve it before some art-starved admirer pockets the pebble for his own. Head out to the Sohm Al summit, and search for Mogwin's masterpiece.

You search Sohm Al's summit and find Mogwin's painted pebble. Return to Moghome, and deliver the work of art to its forgetful creator.

After handing the retrieved pebble to Mogwin, the moogle artist shares with you the name of the masterpiece: Contemplations of Zenith. Gleeful at the thought of the kupo nuts he will receive in exchange for his work, the trial-giver promises to sing your praises to Chieftain Moglin.
