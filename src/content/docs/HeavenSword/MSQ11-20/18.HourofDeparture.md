# Hour of Departure

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- Alphinaud has a final task for you before departing for Azys Lla.

Alphinaud

-- Given the danger of the task that lies before us, I think it only right that we take a moment to bid our friends and allies farewell. Alas, Cid requires my assistance with Master Matoya's rather singular writings. Might I entrust the task of visiting those who will remain behind to you?

-- Before we depart for Azys Lla, it is only meet that we bid farewell to those who will remain behind. I should be obliged if you would attend to this, while I assist Cid.

Aymeric

-- So the hour is nigh... Would that I could join you in the coming battle, but with my wounds, I fear I would only be a burden to you. In consorting with the Ascians and availing himself of primal powers, my father made himself an enemy of all that is good and right in the world. Do whatever you must to end his madness. May the Fury watch over you.

Lucia

-- This is it, then? Go well, my friend. I shall pray to the Fury for your preservation. ...Hm? Mayhap you think it strange that a daughter of Garlemald should pray? I do not blame you─I used to think it passing strange myself. But that all changed when I discovered something dearer to me than mine own life. Thereafter, praying seemed the most natural thing in the world. Prayers are born of heartfelt faith. In manipulating the people's beliefs for his own twisted ends, the archbishop makes a mockery of their very existence. It cannot be borne. Go well, my friend. May the Fury bless you and keep you.

Tataru

-- So you're off to face the archbishop, then... Please be careful. And...watch over the others, will you? We've lost too many friends as it is. Some may yet return to us, but I couldn't bear to lose anyone else. I just couldn't. I realize it's asking a lot, but you're the strongest person I know, and I don't think there's anything you can't achieve if you put your mind to it. So please, whatever else happens, keep everyone safe!

-- You're the strongest person I know, Luna. If anyone can do this, you can. Just make sure everyone comes back in one piece, all right!?

Hilda

-- Well, if it ain't my old friend Luna. Off to face the archbishop and his cronies, is it? I'd love to go and give those bastards a good wallopin' myself--that snake Charibert, especially--but I've got to stay here and keep an eye on things. With the archbishop gone, some of the poor folk might get it in their heads to do somethin' stupid like stormin' the Pillars. But blood won't get us what we want, and I need to be around to remind 'em of that in case they forget.No need to worry about us, anyway. I'll work with Ser Aymeric to preserve the peace. You just concentrate on settlin' the score with the archbishop, eh?

Symme

-- We'll keep the city in one piece, don't you worry!

Eduestand

-- We won't get up to no mischief while you're gone. Not too much, anyway!

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- Mistress Kali, how good of you to pay me a visit. It feels as if it were only yesterday when first we met here in this chamber. You came to us a fugitive seeking asylum...and now you bear the hopes of our nation upon your shoulders. He would not have told you, but when Haurchefant begged me to accept you into our household, he described you as “hope incarnate.” At the time, I assumed that he was waxing lyrical, as was his wont. But I have come to see that he simply spoke the truth. You are hope--a shining beacon that shall guide the people of Ishgard through the raging snowstorm. ...A memento. Were my son here, he would have wished to fight at your side in the battle to come. Take care, my friend, and return to us!

Alphinaud

-- ...Count Edmont bequeathed to you Lord Haurchefant's shield? A noble gesture. We bear the hopes and dreams of full many souls. Let their faith in us be a source of strength and courage as we face our remaining trials.

<div class="border p-6">
While waiting for Cid to finish building the aetheric ram, Alphinaud suggests that you pay a visit to those who will remain in Ishgard. Begin by speaking with Aymeric, who stands nearby.

Aymeric expresses regret that he cannot join you in the battle to come, and gives you his blessing to do whatever is necessary to stop his father. Having bid the lord commander farewell, it is time to visit your other allies in Ishgard. Seek out Lucia at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly, Tataru in the Forgotten Knight, and Hilda in the Brume.

You have spoken with Lucia, Tataru, and Hilda, and received words of encouragement from all concerned. Before returning to the airship landing, pay a final visit to Lord Edmont at Fortemps Manor.

In a touching gesture, Lord Edmont bequeaths to you the shield that his son used to save your life. Noble Haurchefant...a man of no less courage than you, and no less honor, but one upon whom Hydaelyn never smiled. Inwardly, you reaffirm your vow to exact vengeance upon Ser Zephirin. Return to the airship landing and inform Alphinaud that you are ready to leave.

Having said your farewells, you are now ready to embark upon your mission to the floating isle of Azys Lla.

# The First Flight of the Excelsior🎧😭

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- The game will soon be afoot, and Alphinaud is keen to assemble the players.

Alphinaud

-- Work on the Enterprise is nearly complete. Let Y'shtola know to make ready.

Y'shtola

-- Until but recently, the Ishgardians had kept their doors firmly shut to outsiders. But thanks to you, we have found in them stout allies, with whom we may fight to secure the future of the realm. Truly, you are the beacon of hope towards which all men are drawn.

Estinien

-- Spare us the hyperbole. 'Tis not for praise that we fight.

Y'shtola

-- Oh? In light of all we have achieved, I felt it only meet to express my gratitude.

Estinien

-- All that we have achieved? Hmph. Spoken like a true outsider. Until the war is over, we have achieved nothing. The coming battle is a chance to excise the root of this conflict, and by my hand, it shall be done. Then you may speak of achievement.

Y'shtola

-- 'Twas not mine intent to make light of your struggle. If I have given offense, then I apologize. But if I may speak freely, you would do well to be wary of the Eye. Even now, it burns with insatiable hatred, watching unblinking for a sign of weakness. Should you falter for so much as a moment, it will surely consume you.

Estinien

-- Save your concern. I will consume the Eye ere I let it consume me.

(Estinien leaved, and Urianger come)

Urianger

-- Twelve be praised, thou hast not yet set forth! 	'Cross sand and snow have I journeyed, that I might deliver this gift unto thee.

Y'shtola

-- White auracite... But whence did it come?

Urianger

-- To mine amazement, it lay hid amongst Moenbryda's last effects. 'Twas but blind chance, or providence, that I did hap to spy it. Let no man claim that my late friend e'er erred for lack of foresight. In the place whither thou goest, servants of Darkness do lie in wait. Pray give unto me thy pledge that thou wilt strike them down and avenge our fallen comrade.

Urianger

-- That which man thinketh a trifle in the having, he mourneth as a treasure in the losing. A tired platitude, but one which shall haunt me unto my dying day.

Estinien

-- The revelations of recent days may have overturned the foundations of my faith, but my purpose remains unchanged: ending this damnable war.

Alphinaud

-- Let us go, Luna! Azys Lla awaits!

Cid

-- Ah, excellent timing! We've just finished our work on the Enterprise. She's so much improved, I've decided to give her a new name to suit: The Enterprise Excelsior! Or simply the Excelsior, if pressed for time. Once again, she'll carry Eorzea's protectors into battle!

Wedge

-- All aboard!

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- I can do no more than see you off with prayers for your safety and success. Yet know that wheresoever you may go, my son's spirit goes with you. May the Fury grant you strength!

Aymeric

-- Return to us─all of you!

Cid

-- Enterprise Excelsior...engage!

(Upon traversing an arduous journey, you reached Azys Lla, the ethereal floating isle, clinging to the hope that the wisdom gleaned from Sharlayan and the awe-inspiring power of the Eye would render the shield permeable.)

-- This is it! Get ready!

Estinien

-- Eye of mine enemy! Render unto me thy power!

(Suddenly, Estinien was seized by agonizing torment, causing his face to contort in pain.)

-- Ugh... No... You will not claim me! I am the master!

(With a masterful display of manipulation, Cid shattered the formidable barrier encircling Azys Lla, paving the path for the Excelsior to triumphantly navigate through its ethereal expanse.)

Alphinaud

-- We're through!

(Before people could even fully rejoice, they were startled as a colossal battleship, long-awaited and massive, loomed near them.)

Biggs

-- Chief! We've got an imperial battleship on our tail! And it's bleedin' massive.

Cid

-- Damn it! The bastards were waiting for us to open the door for them! I'm going to try to shake them! Hang on to something! 

Wedge

-- Uwaaaaaah! We're all going to die! Tataruuu!

(Alas, even in the hands of the esteemed Master Cid, the Excelsior remained ensnared by ill fortune, unable to evade the merciless trajectory of a colossal battleship's lethal cannonball.)

Biggs

-- She won't take much more of this!

(Suddenly, Ysayle drove Hraesvelgr appeared)

Ysayle

-- The time is come to use Hydaelyn's gift. Much blood has been spilled in my name. And for what? For a false cause that I created for want of the warmth of companionship. Saint Shiva...Hraesvelgr... Pray forgive this fool. But even now, I cannot let go of my dream─my dream of a tomorrow in which no child need freeze alone in the snow.

(Ysayle jumped out of the back of Hraesvelgr)

-- Thank you, Hraesvelgr.

Alphinaud

-- Is that...Ysayle? What does she mean to do!?

Ysayle

-- O goddess born of mine own hopes and dreams. For the last time, I beseech you! Fill this vessel with your light! Still the hatred within our hearts and bless us with eternal grace!

(Ysayle become the Shiva, bar before the massive battleship. After battle, though the battleship got damaged, Shiva's light is no more.)

Ysayle

-- Farewell, Warrior of Light. And thank you─for showing me the way.

Alphinaud

-- NOOOOOO!

Y'shtola

-- This aether... It was a Crystal of Light. She, too, was one of Hydaelyn's chosen...

Estinien

-- Fare you well, my lady.
</div>

‍

<div class="border p-6">
Alphinaud

-- Ysayle... I cannot believe she is gone...

Y'shtola

-- The Echo is a gift and a burden both...as you know only too well.

Estinien

-- Though we walked opposing paths, Iceheart was a worthy woman. Her deeds will not soon be forgotten.

Wedge

-- I-I wasn't afraid! N-Not in the least! ...Pardon? What smell? <sniff> ...Oh gods, someone's spilled something down my trousers!

Biggs

-- Taking on an imperial battleship by herself... Primal or no, that took some courage.

Cid

-- Whew... I don't know about you, but I'm glad to be back on solid ground─even if said ground is floating in the sky. When that imperial battleship appeared, I honestly thought we were finished. And we would have been, had your friend not arrived when she did.

Alphinaud

-- Twelve grant her mercy... Brief though our time together was, Ysayle was a true friend─a gentle soul who fought for her beliefs. She...she would have made a fine Scion.

Y'shtola

-- What is a Scion but one who fights for our cause? Our hopes survive thanks to her sacrifice. Let that be enough. Yet I cannot help but wonder: how came she to know of our presence here?

Estinien

-- From Hraesvelgr, I would wager. He will have felt my channeling of the Eye's power. It would seem they were able to make peace with one another in the end.

Cid

-- She gave her life because she believed in us. We owe it to her to see our mission through.

-- See that dome-like structure further in? Let's make our way there.

<div class="border p-6">
Alphinaud

-- Cid is right. We owe it to Ysayle to see the mission through.

Estinien

-- I sense an ominous presence...

Y'shtola

-- Heavy though our hearts may be, we must forge on─in the name of those we have lost.

Wedge

-- Crikey... This place is like something out of my dreams...

Biggs

-- It's still active─all of it...

Cid

-- The isle's sentinels don't seem to frequent this area. We should be safe here. Let's talk strategy, shall we?

<div class="border p-6">
With work on the Enterprise nearing completion, Alphinaud bids you tell Y'shtola to make ready for departure.

You find Y'shtola in uncommonly good cheer─in stark contrast to Estinien, who seems to take her positivity as a personal affront. As you look on bemused, a tense exchange ensues in which Y'shtola warns Estinien that the Eye will consume him given the slightest opportunity. Of course, the dragoon is having none of it. As he strides off, Urianger arrives bearing a gift of white auracite, found among Moenbryda's last effects, thus rounding off your unexpectedly eventful errand. Rejoin Alphinaud at the airship landing.

You inform Alphinaud of the party's readiness to set forth. The time has come to journey to the stage of the final battle─Azys Lla.

You take your place aboard the new and improved Enterprise Excelsior, and after a journey of what feels like mere moments, gain sight of Azys Lla. As promised, the newly installed aetheric ram makes short work of the Allagan barrier, but you have no time to celebrate, as an imperial battleship appears in your wake and opens fire. Hopelessly outmatched, you prepare for the end, only to spy Ysayle riding to the rescue upon Hraesvelgr's back. Transforming into Shiva, she engages the enemy battleship single-handed, and succeeds in incapacitating it at the cost of her own life.

When you subsequently arrive in Azys Lla, you say a silent prayer for the allies who have paid the ultimate price that you might fight on.

All are determined that Ysayle's sacrifice should not be in vain. Join your companions at the dome-like structure, and ask Cid for further instructions.

Cid declares the area safe, and calls a meeting to discuss the next step.

# Systematic Exploration

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- Cid looks like a man with a plan.

Cid

-- First of all, in the interests of efficiency, I suggest we make this place our base camp. We can coordinate the search for the archbishop from here.

Alphinaud

-- I have no objections. Now that we stand upon Azys Lla, I am struck by the vastness of the isle. We must needs be methodical if we are to find our quarry.

Cid

-- Good. Now, unless I'm mistaken, this used to be an airship landing, and a major one at that. From what I know of Allagan design, there should be a terminal nearby that's linked to the isle's operational heart. If we can find such a terminal, we should be able to learn something of the archbishop's whereabouts. Let's split up and look for it.

Alphinaud

-- To think that such a massive structure has been floating above our heads for all these millennia... It beggars belief...

-- What ungodly vessels must the Allagans have built to warrant so vast a landing?

Biggs

-- This place is an engineer's playground. If I had the time, I'd be going over it with a bleedin' magnifying glass.

-- The Empire borrowed most of its technology from Allagan relics. If we can find the terminal, I reckon we can operate it.

Estinien

-- This ominous presence... To whom does it belong?

-- Machines are beyond my ken─I shall leave it to the others to find this “terminal.” Of more concern to me are the dragons that I sense nearby.

Y'shtola

-- Alas, I have found naught of use.

Cid

-- ...Nothing? Damn it. There's just this terminal, then, but it doesn't respond to anything I do. Any bright ideas, Wedge? ...Wedge? He was here just a moment ago. Oh, don't tell me he's wandered off... I'm sorry, Luna, but could you help me search for him? Absent-minded as he is, I worry that he's strayed beyond the landing area, and made friends with the local sentinels.

Guidance Node

-- <blip> Greetings, Mistress Luna. Is there something you wish to know?

Alphinaud

-- This device serves as an aetheryte, yet it is not made of crystal. To think that the Allagans could emulate the properties of so fundamental a substance...

Cid

-- Hm. This isn't quite what I had in mind, but it might just serve. Wedge, bring the node this way, would you? There's something I'd like to try.

-- Node! I need a status report on the facility!

Wedge

-- Gilly! You have to do what the chief says!

-- Yes, that's it! Good girl!

Cid

-- Ah, here we are... Hmmm, not much of note. It appears someone recently reactivated “Helix,” which is this area.

Alphinaud

-- Reactivated, you say?

Cid

-- By the archbishop, I'd wager. I daresay he woke the place up when he used the Vanu's key. Are there any other people in the facility? If so, where? Let's see here... On the “Flagship”─that's the central isle─I'm seeing positive readings within the Aetherochemical Research Facility and the Fractal Continuum... And what have we here? Intruders detected in the Gamma Quadrant, defense system engaged.

Y'shtola

-- Our imperial friends, I suspect. I hope they enjoy the defense system. But what of the archbishop and his cronies?

Cid

-- Hmmm, what might offer an indication? ...Ah! How about this: which area is currently consuming the most energy? ...Somewhere called “Triad Control,” inside the research facility.

Alphinaud

-- And what manner of place is that?

Cid

-- It is, and I quote, “a regulation facility for the 'Warring Triad' test subjects.” And that's all it says. The rest of the information is only accessible to users with consular privileges.

Y'shtola

-- I mislike the sound of this...which leads me to believe that it is indeed the place.

Alphinaud

-- I am inclined to agree with Y'shtola. Whatever it is that the archbishop seeks, it is like to be there.

Cid

-- That settles it, then. Let's find a way to cross over to the Flagship.

Having established a base camp, Cid suggests that you find one of the terminals connected to the isle's operational heart. Search the area for an active terminal.

Your search has yielded nothing. Return to base camp and report to Cid.

As he ponders your report, Cid notices with a start that Wedge has wandered off without a word. Help him find his absent-minded colleague before trouble does.

You find Wedge, who in his turn has found a curious spherical...thing, which turns out to be a “guidance node.” Ask Cid what he makes of this discovery.

With a little prompting, the node furnishes you with a destination: the Aetherochemical Research Facility, situated upon the Flagship. Though it is unclear what the archbishop seeks in the area marked “Triad Control,” you can be sure no good will come of it.

# In Node We Trust

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- The eons-old guidance node is patiently awaiting instructions.

Guidance Node

-- <blip> Greetings, Mistress Luna. Is there something you wish to know?

Me:

-- Tell me how to reach the Flagship.

Guidance Node

-- <blip> Requesting access to the Aetherochemical Research Facility... Access granted. Generating route... <blip> Route generated. Commencing guidance to chosen destination. Please be aware that the designated route may take you through restricted sectors, and that the isle's defense systems may attempt to terminate you. Be kindly reminded that, in accordance with the terms and conditions of use, you and your party assume all risk of damage or injury, including death, that may occur en route to your destination.

Cid

-- Should you need to return to Ishgard for supplies, you can use that standard to signal for an Ironworks airship, just as before. When your business below is done, let our man at the airship landing know, and he'll ferry you back here to resume the mission.

Wedge

-- Promise me you'll take good care of Gilly! Don't let any harm come to her!

Biggs

-- First Maggie, and now Gilly... Maybe we should have let him have that dog...

Y'shtola

-- Though we know little of the node, we know still less of the facility at large. Let us see where it leads us.

Estinien

-- So we are to follow that...thing? ...I shall leave it to you to deal with it.

Alphinaud

-- Can the guidance node be trusted? I know not, but we have few other options. Let us see where it leads us. Luna, Y'shtola, Estinien─we four shall proceed to the research facility. Cid, the Excelsior is our sole means of escape. Pray remain here and have her ready to depart at a moment's notice.

Cid

-- Understood. We'll see that she's repaired and ready to fly. If anything happens, just let me know via linkpearl.

Alphinaud

-- Be on your guard, my friends─the enemy could be anywhere.

Estinien

-- We have scarce begun, and already it leads us to a dead end.

Y'shtola

-- Mayhap the node has further instructions for us.

Alphinaud

-- If I am not mistaken, this is some manner of teleportation device.

Guidance Node

-- <blip> You are currently within the Alpha Quadrant. First, you must use the nearby matter conduit to travel to the Beta Quadrant. Please wait a moment while I activate it.

-- Conduit activated. You may travel to the Beta Quadrant at your leisure.

Alphinaud

-- The matter conduit appears to operate on the same principle as the aetherytes. How remarkable that it should still function after all this time...

Y'shtola

-- That node is not what it seems. From amidst the metal, I sense the gaze of a living being. Have care around it.

Estinien

-- Are you certain it is wise to trust this orb with our lives?

Guidance Node

-- According to my records, this conduit was last serviced approximately five thousand and fourteen years, six months, eleven days, seven hours and thirteen minutes ago.

It appears that the guidance node can show you the way to the Aetherochemical Research Facility upon the “Flagship,” Azys Lla's central isle. Ask Alphinaud how he feels about following the suspiciously helpful Allagan machine.

For want of a surer way to reach your destination, it is decided that you will trust the guidance node. Follow the node to Matter Conduit II-III and ask it for further instructions.

If the guidance node is to be believed, the matter conduit will send you to the Beta Quadrant. Operate the Allagan transporter at the center of the conduit when you are ready to proceed.

You use the matter conduit and emerge, as promised, in the Beta Quadrant. Request further instructions from the guidance node.

In a manner ill befitting a machine, the guidance node expresses surprise that the conduit still functions correctly after over five millennia of disuse.

# Chimerical Maintenance

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- The guidance node is ready to take you through the Beta Quadrant.

Guidance Node

-- <blip> Resuming guidance to the Aetherochemical Research Facility. Please follow me. This sector, the Beta Quadrant, is home to laboratories which produce chimerical life-forms for both military and household applications. Our facility has been awarded three-star certification for compliance with ASO-3001. The good behavior of the creatures born here is guaranteed. Please be warned, however, that millennia of neglect may have had an adverse effect on their disposition. For your own safety, please refrain from approaching the creatures.

Alphinaud

-- The area teems with chimerical creatures. Be on your guard.

Estinien

-- The orb is beginning to try my patience.

Y'shtola

-- The Allagans did not respect life. Brilliant as they were, I cannot bring myself to respect them.

Guidance Node

-- <blip> Unable to activate matter conduit. Energy shortage detected. Identifying cause... Cause identified: unauthorized siphoning of energy by chimerical creatures. Locations: the Recombination Labs and the Biomass Incubation Complex.

Alphinaud

-- Time is short--let us split up and eliminate the culprits. Luna, pray dispatch the creatures at the Recombination Labs. The rest of us shall sweep the Incubation Complex. Take care, and return hither when you are done.

Estinien

-- I welcome the chance to limber up ahead of the battle to come.

Alphinaud

-- I can hold my own!

Y'shtola

-- What has gotten into Alphinaud all of a sudden?

Alphinaud

-- While facing the chimerical creatures, I had a moment of inspiration. I feel I have attained a better affinity with arcane entities.

Y'shtola

-- Alphinaud has come far. Master Louisoix would be proud.

Estinien

-- Machines are not to be trusted, least of all those that can think.

Guidance Node

-- <blip> Energy restored to the conduit. Please wait a moment while I activate it.

-- Conduit activated. You may travel to the Gamma Quadrant at your leisure.

Y'shtola

-- The next quadrant awaits. Let us make haste.

Alphinaud

-- So the Garleans managed to land... Repairs on their vessel appear to be well underway.

Y'shtola

-- I doubt that they will leave any time soon, however. Nay, they will remain here long after they have stripped the isle of all its secrets.

Estinien

-- Whether or not they mean to linger, their presence here and now is an unwelcome complication.

Y'shtola

-- Indeed. Let us avoid confrontations unless absolutely needful.

At your word, the guidance node hovers off, but not before warning you that the Beta Quadrant is home to chimerical monstrosities. Follow the node to Matter Conduit IV-V and speak with it to receive further instructions.

You arrive at the next matter conduit only to find that it does not work. According to the guidance node, chimerical creatures nearby are siphoning away the energy necessary for activation. Alphinaud suggests that you split up and eliminate these pests. For your part, see to the creatures at the Recombination Labs.

You have eliminated your share of the chimerical creatures. Make your way back to the guidance node at Matter Conduit IV-V.

With no monsters left to siphon energy, the matter conduit comes back to life and is now able to send you to the Gamma Quadrant. Examine the conduit when you are ready to proceed.

You arrive in the Gamma Quadrant to find the place crawling with Garlean soldiers. Their presence is an unwelcome complication to your mission.
