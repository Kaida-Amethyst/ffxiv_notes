# Matoya's Cave🎧

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Y'shtola is ready to lead you to Matoya's Cave.

Y'shtola

-- The cave in which Matoya resides is situated on the southern edge of the hinterlands. In choosing the spot, my master desired privacy above all else. As such, the cave is extremely well hidden; you'll not find it unless you know to look for it. We shall follow the road south until we reach a bridge. Rather than cross it, however, we shall ford the stream it spans, thence head straight until we arrive at the base of a bluff.

Alphinaud

-- All kinds of herbs grow here, and they appear very well tended.

Y'shtola

-- This is the entrance.
...Hm? You seem unconvinced, Luna. Well, that will only add to the surprise. A word of warning before we proceed: stubborn geniuses make poor hosts, and time will have done naught to improve my master's temperament. Doubt not but that there will be sentinels and traps both to deter unwanted guests. But we'll not be deterred, will we? Go on and touch the wall yonder. You will want to have your weapon near at hand.

-- What are you waiting for? Go on and touch the wall yonder.

(You cautiously reach out your delicate hand towards the Icy Wall, and in an instant, three Guards with frog-like appearances materialize before you. Despite their inferior combat prowess compared to yours, a lingering sense of unwelcome permeates the air, suggesting you have not yet gained the favor of the master here.)

Ballon

-- None shall pass, ribbit!

Y'shtola

-- Those sentinels may suffice to discourage the average trespasser, but not the Warrior of Light. The way should now be clear. Come, let us go and see my master.

Matoya

-- Don't you know it's rude to enter without knocking? Hmph, the youth of today─no manners at all...

Y'shtola

-- Though we neglected to knock, we did create something of a commotion. I had hoped that would suffice.

Matoya

-- Heavy-handed as ever, I see. And still not a hint of grace. Some things never change.

Y'shtola

-- To give credit where credit is due--I learned from the best. It has been too long, Master Matoya.

Matoya

-- Indeed it has. It's good to see you again, my girl, and with your fiery spirit unquenched. But look at you─all grown up and womanly.

-- ...The one there in the fancy duds─that's Louisoix's granddaughter, I take it?

Alphinaud

-- Ahem. Grandson, begging your pardons. You knew my grandfather, my lady?

Matoya

-- ...Knew him? We were constantly at each other's throats! Like rabid dogs, we were! He was a stubborn bugger, was your grandfather. Never a dull moment when he was around, though, I'll give him that. As for you, boy, I've known you since you were a rosy-cheeked babe at the teat.

Alphinaud

-- And my sister, too, I gather. May I say what an honor it is to meet you again, my lady.

Matoya

-- Spare me the hollow pleasantries, boy. I'll wager my remaining good teeth you didn't come to a forgotten corner of Eorzea to flirt with a wrinkly old woman. Now, out with it─what is it you need of me?

(Alphinaud proceeds to recount the recent events in Ishgard to Master Matoya, particularly focusing on the barrier surrounding Azys Lla. In a fleeting instant, you catch a glimmer of intrigue sparkling in Master Matoya's eyes as that enigmatic name escapes Alphinaud's lips.)

Matoya

-- Azys Lla... I never thought I'd hear that name again...

Y'shtola

-- You are familiar with it?

Matoya

-- As familiar as one can get from poring over musty old tomes. The Allagans set the isle afloat not long before the sun set on their empire. Old Louisoix and I often talked about it. The place is home to a research facility dedicated to finding ways of mastering mighty beings such as primals and dragons. And find ways it did, too--frightening ones. Such secrets as lie buried on Azys Lla aren't fit to see the light of day. And now you tell me a band of dragon-baiting primal-botherers are trying to dig them up!?

Alphinaud

-- Indeed. And to make matters worse, the Ascians have a hand in their plot. They must be stopped, no matter the cost.

Matoya

-- I see. Very well.

Y'shtola

-- You will help us, then? Truly? I had not anticipated such an impassioned response. Could it be that the presence of young blood has stirred your own?

Matoya

-- Ah, some things never change... One day, that pertness is going to cost you your tail, my girl. Don't say I didn't warn you.

Y'shtola

-- Being here calls to mind my days studying under Matoya. Though she was the strictest--and most irascible--of mentors, she led by example and inspired one to greater heights. Were it not for her sage guidance, I should not be the woman I am.

Alphinaud

-- Do you see the tomes lying about like so many cheap romances? They are priceless. My professors at the Studium would have fits if they saw them in this state.

According to Y'shtola, the cave in which Matoya resides is situated on the southern edge of the Dravanian hinterlands. Follow the road south through the Answering Quarter, ford the stream when you come to a broken bridge, and rejoin your companions at the base of a bluff.

You arrive at the bluff, but there is no cave to be seen. Set aside your skepticism and do as Y'shtola bids: lay a hand upon the nearby wall, and have the other ready to draw your weapon.

Laying your hand on the wall, you are set upon by ferocious frogs, but they are no match for you. Speak with Y'shtola to receive further instructions.

Y'shtola leads you inside the cave, where you are greeted by Matoya. Following a touching reunion and a brief trip down memory lane, Alphinaud reveals to the old hermit the purpose of your visit: building an aetheric ram and gaining entry to Azys Lla. Much to Y'shtola's surprise, her ordinarily truculent master agrees to lend her aid to your cause.

# Forbidden Knowledge🎧

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Matoya is in a mood to reminisce.

Matoya

-- 'Twas some fifty years ago, shortly after Garlemald had brought all of Ilsabard under its rule. Faced with the threat of invasion, the people of Sharlayan scrambled about for a means to resist the Empire. For my part, I was tasked with developing an aetheric converger.

Y'shtola

-- Ah, yes, a device which draws in aether and concentrates it to produce a destructive force.

Matoya

-- But as my research neared its end, it was denounced by the Forum, who claimed that my device was more likely to destroy us than our enemies. After that, they and I had a little falling-out, and I decided to seal away all the fruits of my research, lest the dunderheaded ingrates reap any benefit. Petty, I know, but gods, it was satisfying!

Y'shtola

-- Do mine ears deceive? 'Twas you, was it not, who was so fond of saying that all knowledge exists to advance mankind? That how it is used depends on us?

Matoya

-- I don't remember. Perhaps. All right, yes, that was a pet phrase of mine. And that should give you a notion of how sick and tired I was of those spineless wretches of the Forum. All talk and no trousers, that lot. That's why I decided to remain behind rather than join the exodus.

Alphinaud

-- You may have had your disagreements with my grandfather, but upon that point, your minds were as one.

Y'shtola

-- With respect, Master─the fruits of your research should not be left to spoil. Will you share with us the secrets of the aetheric converger?

Matoya

-- Aye, I will. All the information you need is contained in a tome I wrote on the subject. But you'll have to fetch it from the forbidden section of the Great Library.

Y'shtola

-- You were not exaggerating when you said that you had sealed it away. Though the city is abandoned, the library's guardians are all but certain to remain. We must needs cut a path through them. Come─let us away.

Matoya

-- Not so fast! You don't expect that you can just waltz on in, now, do you?

Matoya

-- Oh, the Great Library's guardians shouldn't pose any difficulty for a hero like you. But if it turns out you aren't up to the task... Well, then I'll know you can't be trusted with something as dangerous as an aetheric ram. I'll put a pair of familiars at your disposal. One's a poroggo who'll help you locate the tome. The other's that broom yonder, who'll let you into the library. ...Well? What are you waiting for? Introduce yourself, girl.

-- Are you going to introduce yourself to that broom or not? No skin off my nose if you don't.

Alphinaud

-- Among other things, Master Matoya is an authority in familiars. After we have tended to our task, perhaps I shall beg her for some insights on the subject...

Y'shtola

-- The Great Library was more than just a repository for tomes; it also served as a center of research for countless fields of study. Fields such as the development of arcane entities, the fruits of which were employed as the library's sentinels. We must be ever on our guard.

Enchanted Broom

-- Greetings, good madam. I am Broomsy, my lady's servant of some fifty years. May I say what an honor it is to serve you! I am given to understand you wish to enter the Great Gubal Library. To find it, pray head east upon leaving this cave. The building will come into view shortly after you reach the collapsed bridge. I shall go and fetch my fellow familiar on my way to the entrance. When your preparations are in order, pray come and meet me there. It will be my pleasure to unlock the door for you.

(Following Master Matoya's instructions, you trailed behind the two familiars she conjured, eventually arriving at the Great Gubal Library after a slight detour)

Alphinaud

-- The Great Gubal Library... Whatever the reason, it boggles my mind to think that such a grand repository of knowledge could be abandoned.

Y'shtola

-- As a child, I would often come here. Not only on Master Matoya's errands, but for my own research besides.

Pero Roggo

-- I am Pero Roggo, ribbit, and it shall be my pleasure to guide you in the library.

Broomsy

-- You stand before the Great Gubal Library, one of Hydaelyn's foremost repositories of knowledge. Alas, it has fallen into disuse since the exodus some summers since. In all those years, its halls have welcomed not the coming of a single soul─its floors felt not the loving brush of a broom... M-Mine apologies, madam! Pray pay no mind to the dreams of a humble broom. You are doubtless eager to venture within and retrieve my lady's tome. I shall unlock the door at once. When you have what you seek, pray return to the cave and report to my lady.

-- I wish you good fortune in your search. When you have what you seek, pray return to the cave and report to my lady.

The Great Gubal Library (Description)

Built by the learned men and women of Sharlayan, the Great Gubal Library is the grandest repository of knowledge in all of Eorzea. Lining its towering shelves are tomes beyond count, gathered from the farthest reaches of the realm. Like the city–state, however, the library was abandoned by its caretakers when they fled to their motherland in the face of Garlean invasion. And now, fifteen years since its doors were sealed, you will be the first soul to set foot within its halls. Your destination is the forbidden section deep within the library, where lies your objective: the fruits of Matoya's research on the aetheric converger.

-----------------------------------------------------
The following is the content of tomes lying the Library
-----------------------------------------------------

On Garlean Hierarchy Volume 1

The rise of the Garlean Empire in the Year 1522 of the Sixth Astral Era led to significant changes in the structure of Garlean society. This is most evident in the adoption of titles which serve to indicate an individual's place within the social hierarchy.
The following information was compiled with the aid of informants within the Empire and has yet to be verified:
Royalty: Zos - The emperor; Yae - Member of the royal family in the line of succession; Wir - Member of the royal family with no claim to the throne.
Military: Van - Legatus; Tol - Tribunus laticlavius; Sas - Tribunus angusticlavius or Praefectus castrorum; Rem - Primus pilus or Pilus prior; Quo - Primi ordines or Centurion; Pyr - Optio, Tesserarius, or Decurion; Oen - Duplicarius or Legionarius.
Specialists: Nan - Chief engineer or engineer; Mal - Primus medicus or senior magitek technician; Lux - Chief medicus or magitek technician; Kir - Senior medicus or senior technician; Jen - Medicus or technician.
Public Officials: Iyl - Dictator or Princeps senatus; Het - Consul, Praetor, Tribunus plebis, Aedilis, or Quaestor; Goe - Censor; Fae - Unknown; Eir - Unknown; Dus - Lictor.

This hierarchy extends to the general populace as well, though it is far less complex. The majority of citizens bear the “Bas” title, and there is a smaller group which appears to be comprised of respected artisans who have adopted the “Cen” title.
The “Aan” title is bestowed upon the peoples of annexed territories and indicates that they lack even the most basic rights afforded to a citizen.
However, many Garleans view this as an opportunity rather than a condemnation, as citizenship may be granted to those who have demonstrated exceptional skills, as well as those who have contributed twenty or more years of military service.

Over the Horizon

Though there is some debate as to whether or not Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn and her League of Lost Bastards were the first Eorzeans to discover the western continent, there is no denying that their navigational charts were instrumental in establishing the major trade routes of today.
Moreover, the accounts from their expedition are widely regarded as both informative and entertaining. Of particular note is their first encounter with the Mamool Ja, as well as other indigenous peoples and creatures which seemed curiously intent on their demise.
These travel journals have since inspired a legion of explorers and treasure hunters to retrace the League's journey. Yet in spite of their numbers, the existence of “a bleedin' city o' gold” remains unconfirmed...

Leather-bound Diary

Beauty is ephemeral, but it needn't be. My lady Amandine knows this well, lovely creature that she is. Would that I could have the genuine article in my keeping...but alas, I shall have to settle for a pale imitation.

The vessel is not quite up to my usual standards, but beggars can't be choosers, as they say. I washed and anointed it per the instructions, then secured it to the bed with chains─wouldn't want her to get ideas above her station, oh no!
Gods, just the thought of it is enough to get my blood pumping! I can hardly wait to welcome my beloved succubus into this world!

Leather-bound Diary (another)

The tentacles...so many tentacles! And the sound of it writhing on the bed! Gods, just listening to it is agony!

I've made a terrible mistake.

Alphinaud

-- So this is the tome. Excellent. Let us take it to Master Matoya at once.

(With the coveted tome finally in your possession, there remains scant justification for lingering in this place. Drifting back towards Matoya's cave, your gait takes on a leisurely cadence, as if seeking solace in the anticipation of profound revelations that may unfold within the pages of that sacred text.)

Y'shtota

-- As expected, the library was rife with dangers, but full glad I am that I could accompany you. Depending on her mood, Master Matoya may well have forced some of us to stay behind to help repair her sentinels. With her, there's simply no telling...

Alphinaud

-- Ahem... Despite how it may have sounded, I do not exaggerate when I say it was a tremendous learning experience to observe one of Master Matoya's familiars. The insights I acquired, I shall put to good use.

Matoya

-- I take it you found the tome. Well, let's see it, then.

(You have over the tome you found in the Library to Matoya)

Matoya

-- Aye, this is it all right...

Y'shtota

-- I must say, the experience brought back memories. Just like the old days, you still send people into the thick of danger as if it were nothing more than a mundane errand.

Alphinaud

-- But we were able to accomplish our task thanks to Pero Roggo. He is an eminently capable familiar─a creation worthy of the great Master Matoya─and to simply witness him in action gave me a better understanding of arcane entities. Should the opportunity present itself, I should very much like to employ this knowledge for the betterment of mankind─create a new variety of Carbuncle, perhaps...

Matoya

-- Don't get ahead of yourself, boy. Louisoix's grandson or no, it'll take another decade under me before you can call yourself a scholar, and a deal more than that to make you a scholar worth a damn.

Y'shtota

-- As you may have gathered, Master Matoya is not easily impressed.

Alphinaud

-- ...Indeed. Ahem. So, shall we examine the tome?

Y'shtota

-- 'Tis well that you were able to retrieve the tome. Had you failed, Master Matoya planned to have us take dictation while she quoted its contents from memory.

Matoya shares with you the tale of her work on a device known as an aetheric converger, and how it led to a bitter falling-out between her and her peers. The fruits of her research were apparently compiled within a tome which now lies sealed within the Great Gubal Library, and you must overcome the dangers within if you wish to retrieve it. Ask Matoya for further instructions.

Matoya loans you a pair of her servants, one to help you locate the tome within the library, and another to unlock the facility's long-sealed doors. Make yourself known to the latter─a broom.

Having introduced himself as Broomsy, the surprisingly eloquent sweeping implement furnishes you with directions to the Great Library. Upon leaving Matoya's Cave, you are to make your way east; the library building will come into view upon gaining the collapsed bridge. Speak with Broomsy when you arrive, and he will unlock the door for you.

The Great Gubal Library is ready to receive its first visitors in fifteen years. Brave the dangers within and retrieve Matoya's tome.

You have survived the trials within the Great Gubal Library. Make your way back to the outside world.

Upon defeating the library's final guardian, the Crystal of Water regains the power of the Light. Soon after, you find what you can only assume is Matoya's tome on the aetheric converger. Bear the book back to Matoya, who awaits you within her cave.

Matoya confirms that you have retrieved the correct tome. All that remains is to put the knowledge it contains to use.

# An Eye for Aether🎧

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Matoya's gaze is firmly fixed upon her tome.

Matoya

-- I had not thought to behold this tome again... 

(With a graceful flick of her wand, Matoya recited an incantation, weaving a tapestry of spells that effortlessly cascaded from her lips. Delicate slivers of ethereal blue light spilled forth, crackling with an otherworldly electricity. It became apparent that her precious tome had been meticulously encrypted, ensuring its secrets remained guarded.)

-- There. It is deciphered. Now your friend should be able to make sense of the contents. That said, it's one thing to understand the workings of the aetheric converger, and another to actually make it work. You do realize how much aether is required?

Alphinaud

-- Cid is keenly aware of the energy dilemma. His airship is by no means large, and it can only bear a limited quantity of crystals.

Y'shtola

-- If only we had white auracite and the aetheric siphon...

Alphinaud

-- Alas, Minfilia is missing, along with both artifacts. And Moenbryda is gone...

Y'shtola

-- Would that there were another ready wellspring of energy for us to draw upon...

Alphinaud

-- Why did it not occur to us before? We already have what we need: the Eye! It has been drawing aether into itself for as long as the great wyrms have lived! It is a veritable wellspring of energy!

Matoya

-- Hm, it might just suit our needs. But is this energy something that can be harnessed at will?

Alphinaud

-- I believe so─with the aid of the Azure Dragoon of Ishgard.

Y'shtola

-- Then it is settled. Let us return to the Holy See at once.

Matoya

-- Shtola, wait. When did the light fade from your eyes?

Y'shtola

-- I might have known that it would not escape your notice. It has been this way since I returned from the Lifestream. An aftereffect of the teleportation magick I invoked, most like.

Matoya

-- They are called “forbidden spells” for a reason. What were you thinking, girl?

Y'shtola

-- I have no regrets. I but did what was necessary to preserve the light of hope─to keep my promise to Minfilia. Besides, it afforded me the rare opportunity to wander the aether─a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Matoya

-- I need not tell you that it consumes your very life force to see by sensing the aether around you. Take care of yourself, do you hear me?

Y'shtola

-- I will, Master Matoya. And thank you.

-- Thanks to your customarily heroic efforts, we now possess the knowledge to build an aetheric ram. All that remains is to secure its energy source. Let us hasten back to Ishgard and consult Ser Aymeric regarding the Eye.

Aymeric

-- Ah, you are returned!

Alphinaud

-- Ser Aymeric, I am pleased to see that your recovery proceeds apace. May I introduce Y'shtola, a fellow Scion of the Seventh Dawn and Archon of Sharlayan.

Y'shtola

-- My lord. Pray excuse me for forgoing due pleasantries, but we seek your counsel regarding the aetheric ram. Though we now possess the knowledge to build such a device, we yet lack an appropriate source of energy with which to power it. We believe, however, that Ishgard may possess the solution to our problem.

Aymeric

-- You need not apologize, my lady. Full eager am I to learn of your progress. Please, tell me of this energy source that you believe we possess.

(You elaborate the theory contained in Matoya's theory and express the requirement of the Eye, which could lend endless power that can be utilized in aetheric converger)

-- ...And you are certain that the Eye can lend its power to Master Matoya's aetheric converger?

Alphinaud

-- At Estinien's command--yes.

Aymeric

-- Very well. I shall speak with him.

Alphinaud

-- My thanks, Ser Aymeric.

Aymeric

-- Nay, my friend, 'tis I who should thank you─as should every Ishgardian. You labor in our name, with nary a care for your own safety.

Alphinaud

-- Let us next speak with Cid. He will doubtless be eager to begin work on the aetheric ram.

-- I shall personally relay your proposal to Estinien. If that which you ask is possible, you may be assured of his cooperation. My thanks again, Luna.

-- Most folk know Master Garlond as a genius inventor. It's only when you come to work for him that you realize he's a godsdamned tyrant taskmaster. Just, uh...don't tell him I said that, all right?

Wedge

-- A bit of sleep deprivation won't kill me, I suppose. But if it does...well, then I'll have all the sleep I want, and the joke will be on Biggs!

Biggs

-- What do you think? Looks like a different ship, doesn't she?

Cid

-- Ah, you're back! The preliminary work on the Enterprise is more or less finished. Tell me you found a way to build the aetheric ram!

Y'shtola

-- Greetings, Cid. It has been a while. This tome contains the fruits of my former master's research on a device known as an aetheric converger. Our ram should operate on the selfsame principle.

Cid

-- Ack, where are my manners? Put a toy like this in my hand, and I go off into my own world... Gods, it's good to see you! And bearing a gift besides--a very distracting one, if I might add! If I didn't know better, I'd think it was my nameday.

-- ...But there will be time for tearful reunions later. I'll make a start on the tome right away. So long as I have a grasp of the fundamentals, I should be able to knock something together. Which leaves the small matter of the energy source...

Alphinaud

-- We believe we have found a solution to that problem as well.

Aymeric

-- Pray forgive us our lateness.

Estinien

-- The power of the Eye is not to be drawn upon lightly, but I believe we have sufficient cause to do so.

Y'shtola

-- So this is the fabled Eye... By the Twelve...it seethes. 'Tis a wonder such power can be contained, much less controlled...

Cid

-- Boys! Our friends have kindly provided all the ingredients. Let's see if we can't make something out of them!

Biggs

-- You heard the chief! We're not resting till the aetheric ram is operational! Not one wink of sleep!

Wedge

-- Oh... <mumble> <mumble> ...ing cart chocobo.

Aymeric

-- It goes without saying that the Temple Knights will bear the costs for all work on the Enterprise. Would that we could contribute more to the cause.

Estinien

-- Azure wings to bear us to the final battle... I must admit there is poetry to it.

Y'shtola

-- I know naught of the archbishop and his knights save that which you have told me--but if they truly possess the power of primals and the secrets of Azys Lla, they are dangerous foes indeed. We must spare no preparation.

After a moment's reflection, Matoya deciphers the contents of the tome, that Cid might avail himself of her research and build the aetheric ram. However, the question of an energy source remains. Even as you mull over the dilemma, Alphinaud has an epiphany: the Eye is a boundless source of aether! ...But will Estinien relinquish it? Ask Alphinaud how he means to proceed.

Alphinaud intends to consult Ser Aymeric on the possibility of borrowing the Eye. Make your way back to Ishgard, and speak with the lord commander at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly.

Aymeric agrees to speak with Estinien on the matter of the Eye. While he does so, seek out Cid at the airship landing and share with him the knowledge of the aetheric converger.

With the knowledge to build the aetheric ram finally at his disposal, and a suitable energy source secured, Cid sets to work with obvious relish.
