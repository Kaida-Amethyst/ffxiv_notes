## Close Encounter of the VIth Kind🎧

System Guide

-- The guidance node is ready to take you through the Gamma Quadrant.

Guidance Node

-- Warning: intruders detected in force in this quadrant. It is recommended that you avoid confrontation where possible. Be kindly reminded that, in accordance with the terms and conditions of use, you and your party assume all risks of damages or injury, including death, that you may sustain in the course of guidance. Please follow me to the next matter conduit. It leads to the Delta Quadrant, where the facility's greatest achievement is located.

Y'shtola

-- These soldiers bear the sigil of the VIth Legion, ordinarily deployed within Ilsabard. They are certainly a long way from home.

Alphinaud

-- The VIth Legion has long been the favored of Emperor Varis. It is the iron fist with which he crushes uprisings.

Estinien

-- Wait. Something is afoot.

Regula van Hydrus

-- Our objective lies at the heart of the isle. The Third will remain to guard the ship, while the Second patrols the perimeter and eliminates any threats. The First will come with me to secure the research facility. Let no man doubt the import of our mission: the Allagans found a means to capture eikons alive, and their knowledge lies hid upon this isle. If we can but acquire it, we would be able to prevent the beings from returning to plague us, thus ending the cycle of rebirth. I need not remind you that success will raise our legion high in the Emperor's regard. Yet, by the same token, His Radiance does not tolerate failure. That is all. All troops, prepare for deployment!

Y'shtola

-- So that is their purpose.

Alphinaud

-- To think that the knowledge used to bind no less a being than Bahamut sleeps here...

Y'shtola

-- Imprisoning a primal in such a manner would represent an effective means to halt the cycle of summoning--were it not for the grave and obvious risks.

Alphinaud

-- Indeed. We need but refer to past experience─that of Bahamut's calamitous return─to see why this is not the solution we seek.

Y'shtola

-- Held in duress, a primal will continue to nurse its hatred for mankind. And when it inevitably breaks free, its rage will be beyond quelling.

Estinien

-- Whatever folly the Garleans mean to commit, they can wait. We must remain focused on our task.

Alphinaud

-- Yes, of course. It would not be polite to keep the archbishop waiting.

Guidance Node

-- <blip> That you have survived to this point is in defiance of possibility. But it appears the danger is not yet past. <blip> <bloop> WARNING! Intruders approaching. Please eliminate them if you wish to proceed.

Regula van Hydrus

-- That would explain my men's silence. We meet again. And this time, we will not be interrupted. Come! Show me your power, champions of Eorzea!

---------------------------------

Regula van Hydrus: Come, eikon-slayer. Impress me.
Regula van Hydrus: Surely you can do better than that.
1st Maniple Centurion: Let us aid you, Lord van Hydrus!
Estinien Wyrmblood: Hmph, naught but toy soldiers to knock down.
Y'shtola: Leave the rank and file to us! Focus on the legatus!
Alphinaud: Obsidian Carbuncle! Come!
Regula van Hydrus: I need air support! Now!

----------------------------------

-- I had heard the tales of your strength, Warrior of Light. And now that I have experienced it firsthand, van Baelsar's defeat seems less inexplicable. You are a formidable foe, and I have thoroughly enjoyed our time together. Alas, all good things must come to an end. Allagan secrets await, and there is no profit to be had in remaining here.

-- Keep them occupied!

Estinien

-- Coward...

Y'shtola

-- It would seem we have no choice.

Alphinaud

-- 	You must continue on. We will hold them here.

Estinien

-- Take the Eye. It should still hold enough energy to be of use to you. I shall join you as soon as I am able.

Y'shtola

-- Enough talk! Make haste and stop the archbishop!

Guidance Node

-- <blip> Welcome to the Delta Quadrant, where methods are developed for mastering dragons. To this day, the sector is home to live specimens brought over from the southern continent of Meracydia. Truly a testament to the greatness of the Allagan Empire.

The guidance node warns you that the Garleans are out in force in the Gamma Quadrant. Make your way through the area, all the while exercising the utmost caution, and rejoin your comrades near the enemy encampment.

The Garlean force present is revealed to be none other than the VIth Imperial Legion, which you first encountered at the Zundu village. Their purpose is to acquire the knowledge to capture primals, to which end they also seek the Aetherochemical Research Facility. Though their presence complicates matters, you must remain focused on your mission to stop the archbishop. Proceed to Matter Conduit VI-VII.

A squad of imperial troops chase you down as you arrive at the matter conduit, but you succeed in repelling them. Speak with the guidance node again, and pray that there are no further interruptions.

You and your companions are set upon by Regula van Hydrus, legatus of the VIth Legion. Though you are able to overwhelm him, he sets his minions upon you and boards an airship, most certainly bound for the research facility. With time running short, Alphinaud bids you continue your pursuit of the archbishop while he and the others keep the enemy at bay. Having accepted the Eye into your keeping, you use the matter conduit and emerge within a new quadrant. Seek out the guidance node nearby to receive further instructions.

According to the guidance node, the Delta Quadrant, where you now stand, is home to live dragons.

## Fetters of Lament🎧

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- The guidance node has ill tidings to share with you.

Guidance Node

-- <blip> I regret to inform you that the matter conduit leading to the Flagship is no longer functioning. According to my records, it was destroyed by a dragon, which broke free of its restraints when they failed approximately two thousand three hundred and sixty-nine years, one month, twenty-four days, seven hours and four minutes ago. Please find an alternate route to the Aetherochemical Research Facility. The Allagan Research Council apologizes for any inconvenience caused.

Midgardsormr

-- So, thy journey hath led thee to this accursed place. Canst thou hear it, mortal? The ceaseless keening of my kindred, steeped in five thousand years of suffering... Long before the Ishgardians and their base betrayal, there lived still more wicked men whose ambitions knew no bounds. Fearful of our might and covetous of our power, they devised a means to enslave dragonkind... Their vile misdeeds did set in motion a train of events whose repercussions are felt to this day. Beyond, thou wilt find one of my first brood. Hark thou unto her words. Partake thou of her pain. Think thou upon the suffering that the conflict betwixt our kinds hath begot.

System Guide

-- A great wyrm is being held in some manner of restraint.

Tiamat

-- Who cometh to this forsaken place and disturbeth my solitude?

Midgardsormr

-- Tiamat, my child.

Tiamat

-- ...Father? Can it truly be you?

Midgardsormr

-- None other. My form is such that I may journey with Hydaelyn's chosen─A mortal who desireth to end the war between man and dragon.

Tiamat

-- Millennia have passed since I was brought low by the men of Allag. To think that war rageth still between our kinds... Hearken to my tale, child of man. I am Tiamat, of Midgardsormr's first brood. In a time before time, my father did come to this star, bearing seven eggs.

Midgardsormr

-- From these eggs did my children hatch. And once they were full-grown, they took wing and spread across all the lands of Hydaelyn.

Tiamat

-- Together with my brood-brother Bahamut, I journeyed south to Meracydia. And together, we brought forth innumerable children into the world. We abided in peace, and all was well...until the men of Allag came, some five thousand years since. They slaughtered my children in droves, and took from me my beloved Bahamut. 'Twas then, when I had fallen into the depths of despair, that black-robed men came unto me. The Ascians. They offered to resurrect Bahamut through their dark arts, and I, in my grief, accepted─a decision which I shall regret unto my dying breath. For what they brought back was a mockery of my beloved. Worse, the Ascians gifted his murderers the means to entrap him. Know this, child of man: the beings thy kind call gods are but specters of thy mind's creation, given form at great cost to Hydaelyn. Many such beings yet slumber across the land, brought to heel by the selfsame empire that bound me. They must not be released into the world. If thou wouldst end the conflict, vanquish thee the Ascians, and deliver the weak of will from the bonds of their dark influence.

Midgardsormr

-- It hath been five thousand years, my child. Wilt thou not forgive thyself?

Tiamat

-- The release of death is denied me here, yet I desire not freedom. Nay, Father. I shall live with my regret until the world itself hath ceased to be. Such is my just punishment for consorting with Darkness─for calling forth a loathsome and lamentable creature which blackeneth my beloved's memory.

Hydaelyn

-- Warrior of Light. Beloved daughter. The Light abideth within thy heart again. Full valiantly didst thou overcome thy many trials. But glory not in thy success. For the servants of Darkness are ever close at hand. Receive of me my blessing once more, And go forth, to shine thy Light on all creation.

Midgardsormr

-- Thou hast broken down the wall I built around thee, and partaken of thy mistress's blessing once more. Strong art thou, mortal─stronger than any other of thy kind. Having looked upon thy deeds, I am convinced. Thou art worthy to bear Her Light. The covenant bound me to thee, but 'twould seem our fates were mingled from the first. Though I will not fight thy battles, I will yet lend thee my wings.

-- Come, mortal─we go to cast out the Darkness!

System Guide

To your dismay, it appears that the matter conduit leading to the Flagship has long since been destroyed. As you ponder an alternative path to your destination, Midgardsormr manifests and bids you seek out one of his children, who abides in torment nearby.

You come before the great wyrm Tiamat, who has been imprisoned in Azys Lla since before the fall of the Allagan Empire. You listen intently as she tells you of Bahamut's tragic demise and of the Ascians' role in his ill-fated return.

At the meeting's conclusion, your Crystal of Fire regains its light, and you find that you are able to hear Hydaelyn's voice once more. Impressed by your strength, and convinced at last of your worthiness to bear the Light, Midgardsormr offers to carry you to the Flagship, that you might cast out the Darkness which lurks therein.
