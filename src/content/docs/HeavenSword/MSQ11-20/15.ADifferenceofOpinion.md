# A Difference of Opinion🎧

System Guide

-- Alphinaud seems determined to put all thoughts of failure aside, and turn his mind to the struggles ahead.

Alphinaud

-- Though we failed to secure the key, we must not forget that we succeeded in ridding the realm of another primal─and prevented the Vanu Vanu's lands from being consumed in so doing. The Zundu, at least, shall be glad of our deeds this day. Let us go and inform Chief Sonu of our victory. Cid and the others will need a moment to tend to the Enterprise, besides.

Alphinaud

-- Wait. Something is amiss...

Alphinaud

-- Imperial troops─and they have already secured the area.

Regula van Hydrus

-- Reveal yourselves at once!

-- And there I was expecting more beastmen. Who are you!?

Varis zos Galvus

-- I thought Ishgardians responsible for the disappearance of our scouts, but I see now that I was mistaken. Just as Roaille observed. The Warrior of Light is wont to appear at the most inopportune times.

Regula van Hydrus

-- The Warrior of Light? She who bested van Baelsar!?

Varis zos Galvus

-- It would seem that the famous hero of Eorzea seeks Azys Lla as well. Hardly unexpected. The secrets of the Allagans' power to bind eikons to their will could scarcely fail to interest the Scions of the Seventh Dawn...

-- You know as well as we what will ensue should these insatiable creatures be allowed to roam free─that their very existence threatens the life of this star. We but disagree on the solution to the problem.

Alphinaud

-- Genocide has ever been the Empire's favored recourse─and that is why we will continue to oppose your every attempt to claim Eorzea!

Varis zos Galvus

-- You do not hesitate to speak your mind...even when your every word could be your last. Alas, your sentiments betray the narrowness of your view. The fate of Eorzea and its inhabitants is of little concern next to the fate of the world.

-- 'Tis my solemn charge as emperor to bring the eikons to heel. If this requires the extermination of certain elements, then so be it.

Alphinaud

-- No, don't! They are not his thralls!

(An attack)

Regula van Hydrus

-- Where did that come from!?

Lucia

-- Take cover!

Regula van Hydrus

-- Your Radiance, we must withdraw!

Varis zos Galvus

-- We shall meet again, Warrior of Light. On that you have my word.

Alphinaud

-- So Garlemald, too, has designs on Azys Lla... But why would the Emperor himself elect to lead the expedition?

Lucia

-- Ah, the armor? I had it sent here as a precautionary measure...

Alphinaud

-- Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would stand less than twenty paces from the Emperor of Garlemald... Varis zos Galvus in the flesh... I assume the commander that accompanied him must be the legatus of whom the centurion spoke... Ah, forgive me. This is neither the time nor place for such idle speculation. Pray return to the Enterprise at once. It occurs to me that our friends may have run afoul of imperial forces as well. I have yet to apprise Chief Sonu of all that has occurred, but once I have, we will rejoin you at the airship.

-- If you fear for our safety, may I direct your attention to the suit of magitek armor nearby and its exceedingly capable pilot.

Sonu Vanu

-- So they too are seekers of the forbidden secrets, these netherlings of black steel...

Biggs

-- Bugger me, did you see the size of that imperial battleship!?

Wedge

-- We saw it fire on the village! Are you all right, Luna!?

Cid

-- Thank the Twelve you're alive, Luna! When that battleship appeared and fired on the village, we feared the game was up for you and Alphinaud. What in the seven hells happened out there?

-- First the archbishop turns up with an Ascian in tow, and now the godsdamned Emperor pays us a visit!? What is this, a procession of notable bastards? Who's next? The Keeper of the Seventh bloody Gate!?

Alphinaud

-- No one so “notable,” Master Garlond. I am happy to report that the Zundu were overjoyed to learn of Bismarck's demise. Chief Sonu sends his warmest regards, Luna. There was much talk of westerly winds.

Lucia

-- Miraculously, none suffered lasting harm during the raid. It would seem the Zundu were taken entirely unawares, and wisely chose to offer no resistance.

Alphinaud

-- I sense they have no more to fear from the Empire, for the present, at least. Had the Emperor truly been intent on their extermination, Ok' Zundu would already have been leveled. Plainly, Varis is only interested in reaching Azys Lla.

Cid

-- Speaking of which, if you're all ready to continue the chase, the Enterprise is as well. Shall we?

Biggs

-- She's all patched up, Luna!

Wedge

-- I've done it, Luna! I've worked out which way they're headed! Whenever you're ready, we'll set course for Azys Lla!

Lucia

-- And what will we find at the end of the road...?

Alphinaud

-- Well? What are we waiting for?

You return with Alphinaud to the Zundu village, only to find it overrun with imperial troops. Their commanding officer, whom you quickly deduce to be Regula van Hydrus, hears your approach and demands you reveal yourselves. Seeing no other way to ensure the survival of the captured Vanu, you obey, and soon find yourself face-to-face with Varis zos Galvus, the newly crowned Emperor of Garlemald.

Recognizing you and Alphinaud on sight, the Emperor surmises that the Scions of the Seventh Dawn seek Azys Lla in order to learn how the Allagans bound primals to their will. Pricked by Varis's presumption, Alphinaud musters the courage to decry the Empire's actions, only to be brushed aside by the Emperor, who orders his men to execute the captive Vanu Vanu regardless. Yet before they can carry out his command, the soldiers are sent reeling by a sudden barrage of cannon fire, and Lucia, piloting a suit of magitek armor, rushes to your side. Alert to the danger, Regula orders an immediate withdrawal, covered by the guns of the imperial battleship overhead, and though the resulting smoke obscures their retreat, the Emperor's voice─and its promise of a reunion─is unmistakable.

Concerned that imperial troops may have attacked the Enterprise as well, Alphinaud bids you return to Cid while he and Lucia inform the Zundu of Bismarck's demise. Return to the airship and confirm that all is well.

After learning that the engineers did not run afoul of the Garleans, you recount the tale of your meeting with the Emperor to Cid, who reacts more or less as you expected he would. Alphinaud and Lucia return shortly thereafter and inform you that, miraculously, no Zundu died in the imperial raid. Reasoning that Varis would have leveled the Vanu settlement by now if that were his intention, Alphinaud concludes that the Emperor has already fixed his sights on Azys Lla. Happily, repairs to the Enterprise are complete, and the hunt for the archbishop can continue in earnest.

# One Good Turn🎧

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- Judging from Cid's expression, he has news which he believes will please you.

Cid

-- Lest you wonder, Wedge was able to calculate the heading indicated by the beam of light emitted by the key. If Azys Lla lies in that direction, we'll find it. The Soleil may have a lead on us, but she's no Enterprise. We'll catch them─you'll see!

<div class="border p-6">
Lucia

-- I did not think that I would ever have occasion to pilot a suit of magitek armor again─least of all under these circumstances.

-- My full name is Lucia goe Junius, and I was born a citizen of Garlemald.

Cid

-- Ah, that explains it! When we first met in Ishgard, I very nearly called you Livia.

Alphinaud

-- Livia...? Livia sas Junius? The tribunus who served under Gaius van Baelsar!?

Lucia

-- Aye, she was my sister─though we spent little time together. After our parents were killed in an uprising, we were sent to live in different households, setting us on separate paths... Livia felt at home on the battlefield and chose to become a soldier, while I underwent training to become a spy.

Alphinaud

-- Then...Ishgard was...?

Lucia

-- My mission. 'Twas believed that Allagan relics of great worth were stored in the Vault, and I was sent to investigate. Though I was given little information at the time, I now suspect I was searching for the key we but recently lost. And then I met Ser Aymeric. 'Twas his usefulness to my mission which prompted me to approach him, but I soon found myself drawn to him for other reasons. He too was a prisoner of his past─judged for his heritage as a bastard son of the archbishop. Yet unlike my sister and I, he did not curse his fate. He simply rose above it. In time, I came to realize that I had found a man worth following, and a new home besides. And when I subsequently confessed all to Ser Aymeric, he was good enough to accept me into his service.

Alphinaud

-- ...I do not question your loyalty to Ser Aymeric. 'Tis your loyalty to your sister which concerns me.

Lucia

-- I have long been of the opinion that those who dwell in the past risk losing sight of their future. My sister fought for her convictions, and for those she held dear. So do I. So must we all. 

Cid

-- Well, I for one am happy to welcome a fellow Garlean to our merry band--especially one who can make magitek armor sing!

Biggs

-- Chief, we should be getting close.

Wedge

-- Once we break through those clouds, we'll be right where the light was pointing─right where Azys Lla should be!

Cid

-- Hold on, everyone!

Cid

-- Look! I think that's it!

Biggs

-- 	Chief, is that...?

Cid

-- Allagan, aye. There's no mistaking their handiwork.

Alphinaud

-- What was that!?

Cid

-- Some sort of barrier!?

Wedge

-- She won't hold, Chief! She's breaking up!

Biggs

-- I've lost the auxiliary propeller!

Alphinaud

-- Cid, it's no use! We must return to Ishgard and find another way!

Wedge (Fixing his eyes upon the Lucia's magitek armor)

-- I wonder─does she have a name?

Biggs

-- Gods, just thinking about all the repairs we'll have to make is giving me a bleedin' headache...

Lucia

-- What could be out there that would warrant the personal attention of the Emperor himself...?

Alphinaud

-- Cid's piloting under pressure was a marvel to behold─and may I never have the opportunity to do so again.

Cid

-- Ack! And we'd barely finished repairing the damage incurred during our skyfishing trip. On the other hand, any landing you can walk away from, as they say... I can only presume the Soleil passed through the barrier unscathed. That would certainly explain why the Vanu called it a key...

Having calculated the precise direction of the beam of light, Wedge now knows the heading that will lead you to Azys Lla. And so, with Lucia's magitek armor safely stowed aboard the Enterprise, you at last resume your pursuit of the Soleil.

As the land of the Vanu disappears into the distance, Lucia reveals her true identity. She is Lucia goe Junius, Garlean defector, and sister to Livia sas Junius, whom you slew in battle. Sensing your discomfort, Lucia claims to hold no grudge against you─and given her recent performance in battle, Cid is more than happy to take her at her word.

Some hours later, your comrade's calculations are confirmed when the clouds part to reveal the floating isle of Azys Lla. Alas, your progress is halted soon after by a powerful energy barrier which threatens to tear the Enterprise apart. Frustrated, Cid turns the airship around and sets course for Ishgard, lamenting the Allagans' knack for making the simplest of tasks so infernally bloody complicated.

The thought of repairing the Enterprise yet again is enough to fill Cid with dread. On the other hand, any landing you can walk away from...

# An Engineering Enterprise🎧

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- Alphinaud appears relieved to be standing on solid ground once more.

Alphinaud

-- Assuming Cid is correct─and I have no reason to think that he is not─the Vanu's key is required to pass through the barrier protecting Azys Lla. But even without it, we must find a way to reach the isle. I shall have everyone convene at the Seat of the Lord Commander, that we might discuss how best to proceed. As before, make yourself known to the guardsman when you arrive, and he will show you in.

Temple Knight Guard

-- Ah, you are returned! Ser Aymeric and the others await you within!

Alphinaud

-- Though we know little and less of Azys Lla, one thing is plain: the archbishop and the Garleans cannot be allowed to avail themselves of its secrets.

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- Welcome back, my friend, and pray forgive me my earlier display. I grieve for my son still, and shall continue to do so, but I have resolved to be strong. It is what he would have wished.

Cid

-- I swear, wherever there's an Allagan ruin, there's trouble just waiting to happen. I suppose that's why they erected such damnably convoluted defenses around everything...

Lucia

-- If the Empire has an interest in Azys Lla, we have all the more reason to hurry. I would not see its secrets fall into the hands of either the archbishop or the Emperor.

<div class="border p-6">
Cid

-- ...In summary, the isle owes its lofty position to the industry of the Allagans. And we can be all but certain that the archbishop and his cronies are enjoying the view from its top.

Aymeric

-- I see.

Cid

-- If we are to join them, we will first need to pass through the isle's aetheric barrier─which is, alas, more powerful than most. Powerful enough to make a mess of a perfectly good airship, at any rate... As far as I can gather, the barrier mechanism draws aether from the surrounding environment, and polarizes its elemental aspect to produce what is, in effect, a wall of lightning.

Alphinaud

-- It seems plain that without the Vanu's key, any attempt to reach the isle will end in failure.

Cid

-- Alas, the key was careless enough to leave without us, and I don't think the Vanu keep a spare.

Aymeric

-- Master Garlond─based on your experience, is there no other way that we might breach the barrier?

Cid

-- Well, in the past, we've beaten similar barriers by nullifying them with elemental converters. But the one we're up against this time dwarfs aught we've encountered before. The Enterprise simply isn't large enough to bear the requisite amount of crystals.

Alphinaud

-- I am reminded of the quantity needed to nullify Leviathan's command of the sea... A veritable mountain of crystals that could only be borne by lashing two galleons together to form a “twin vessel” scarcely able to propel itself, much less fly.

Cid

-- That said, we're not without options. If it isn't feasible to nullify the barrier, we might try piercing it.

-- We create a ram of condensed aether and mount it on my ship. There's just one problem─I don't have the faintest idea how to build one. It's going to take a true authority in the field, I reckon.

Alphinaud

-- Would that the Archons were still with us...

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- But yesterday evening, I chanced to find Mistress Tataru in unusually high spirits. Assuming I understood her excited ramblings correctly, she has acquired a clue pointing to the whereabouts of one such individual.

Alphinaud

-- An Archon!? Truly!?

Cid

-- Hah, fortune favors the righteous, eh? Well then, let's not waste any time. While you go and look for our missing friend, I'll work on modifying the Enterprise. Her hull will need reinforcing to bear the punishment, not to mention a mount for the ram. Just you wait, my pretty─by the time I'm finished, you'll be an airship reborn!

Aymeric

-- Think not of the cost. Whatever you require to modify the Enterprise, you shall have it.

Alphinaud

-- She may not spend her days slaying primals, but Tataru is no less a Scion than you or me. Full oft has her knack for acquiring information proven vital to our endeavors.

Tataru

-- Welcome back, Luna! How goes the mission? Did you manage to catch up with the archbishop and his cronies? So, you finally arrived at Azys Lla...only to find your way barred by some sort of barrier... Typical. But it's not all bad news! I've made progress in the search for our friends! Don't worry, Luna--we'll get to Azys Lla yet!

<div class="border p-6">
Alphinaud has called a meeting to discuss how Azys Lla's defenses might be breached. Proceed to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly, and speak with the guardsman within to be admitted to the Seat of the Lord Commander.

Cid believes that it may be possible to pierce the barrier surrounding Azys Lla by mounting a ram of condensed aether on the Enterprise. There is just one problem: he has not the faintest idea how to make one. Apparently, designing such a device would require the expertise of a true authority in the field─an authority such as an Archon. Even as Alphinaud laments their absence, Edmont recalls a discussion he had with Tataru, wherein she claimed to have acquired a clue pointing to the whereabouts of one of your missing comrades. Make your way to the Forgotten Knight and trouble her for the particulars.

Tataru confirms that she has made progress in the search for the Archons. Hearing this, you cannot help but smile. With your lost friends at your side, surely nothing will prevent you from reaching Azys Lla.

-- Tataru is eager to share her progress in the search for the missing Scions.

Tataru

-- When you fled the victory feast, you used the ancient watercourse beneath the city, right? Well, shortly after things went back to normal in Ul'dah, I asked Marshal Tarupin to have the tunnels searched.

Alphinaud

-- A logical place to look... It was there that you lost contact with Minfilia, Thancred, and Y'shtola, was it not? Dare I ask what the marshal found?

Tataru

-- Um...I don't actually know. Pipin's message just said that there had been a discovery, and that we were to come to the Hall of Flames at our earliest convenience.

Alphinaud

-- I dare not think what it might be... We shall depart at once. Tataru─let Urianger know to join us in Ul'dah. He will wish to be present as well.

Urianger

-- As thou art returned to us, wherefore might our comrades not be the same? Never shall I concede them lost till I have seen proof of their passing.

Alphinaud

-- We are grateful for your assistance, Marshal Tarupin.

Pipin

-- You saved Her Grace and Father both. 'Tis the least I can do to repay you.

Tataru

-- Forgive me my impatience, Marshal, but your missive mentioned a discovery...?

Pipin

-- Yes, of course. As per your request, I had my men scour the waterways. Almost immediately, we encountered a difficulty: an entire section of the tunnel had collapsed. With the Mineral Concern's cooperation, however, we were able to remove the rubble, which yielded the battered bodies of a dozen Crystal Braves.

Alphinaud (Possibly with a little tense)

-- Go on...

Pipin

-- Be at ease, Master Alphinaud--your friends were not among the deceased. That alone is cause for hope. And then there is this...

Tataru

-- <gasp> Y'shtola's wand!

Pipin

-- I had assumed as much.

Urianger

-- If I may, Marshal...

-- 'Tis as I did surmise. Judging by the aetheric imprint that lingereth yet upon this wand, it hath assuredly been employed in the casting of a most uncommon magick.

Alphinaud

-- Namely?

Urianger

-- The very first that man did conceive to traverse great distances, and the ancient precursor to all methods of travel that utilize the Lifestream: Flow. The spell entaileth the reduction of the corporeal form into its constituent aether, that the caster might enter the Lifestream, and ride its currents thereby. Unlike the teleportation magicks of modern times, it requireth not a lengthy incantation. That Y'shtola should choose to employ such a spell bespeaketh the need for haste.

Alphinaud

-- All of which would suggest she managed to escape!

Urianger

-- Would that it were so simple. Know that the scholars of Sharlayan forbade the use of this spell─and with good reason. The caster hath but limited control over his course. For every mage who came safe unto his destination, another would be set adrift in the Lifestream, never to emerge.

Tataru

-- What? No! No, you can't mean...

Urianger

-- Be not downcast, my friends, for there is yet hope. 'Tis like that Y'shtola's passage hath left traces in the Lifestream. Could we but follow these from the point at which the magick was invoked, we may yet find her.

Alphinaud

-- To the Sil'dih excavation site, then. Our thanks for your aid, Marshal.

Pipin

-- Do not mention it. I shall pray for Lady Y'shtola's safe return.

-- Would that I could be of more assistance, but our nation's resources are stretched thin. Be that as it may, do not hesitate to contact me if there is aught I can do.

Tataru

-- If our friends weren't in the tunnel, that must mean they're somewhere else!

Alphinaud

-- Simply being here calls to mind the events of that fateful day...

Urianger

-- Evidence of Y'shtola's passage will have been made faint by time. But mayhap some few scant traces yet remain to guide our steps.

-- The trail leadeth to the north and east...

-- ...Unto the bosom of the Twelveswood.

Alphinaud

-- Are you certain?

Urianger

-- Aye, there is no mistake─thither hath Y'shtola journeyed.

Alphinaud

-- And yet the Gridanians have reported no sightings. We must take this to mean she is still adrift.

Urianger

-- If it be so, I do fear for our friend. Contrary to its name, the Lifestream is more akin to a raging torrent. Linger overlong in the midst of this maelstrom, and the aether that formeth one's soul shall surely be scattered, ne'er to be reformed.

Alphinaud

-- We have no time to waste. Urianger─pray explore all possible options for reversing the effects of this forbidden magick. Luna, Tataru─we three shall press on to Gridania and petition the Elder Seedseer's aid.

Tataru

-- Hold on, Y'shtola! We're coming for you!

Alphinaud

-- It is said that the elementals perceive the Lifestream. If, as we suspect, Y'shtola is still adrift in its midst, they may be able to find her. But if we are to appeal to them for assistance, we must needs do so through their chosen─the Padjal. It is imperative therefore that we speak with Kan-E-Senna without delay.

Tataru reveals that shortly after General Raubahn's reinstatement, she asked Marshal Tarupin to conduct a search of the watercourse beneath Ul'dah─the place you last saw Minfilia, Thancred, and Y'shtola. Pipin now sends word of a discovery, and asks that you come to the Hall of Flames.

At the Hall of Flames, Pipin produces Y'shtola's wand, retrieved from the rubble of the collapsed watercourse. Upon close inspection, Urianger divines that Y'shtola invoked a forbidden teleportation magick and was sent to an unknown location. In order to find her, you must follow the trail of her passage through the Lifestream, starting from the spot the spell was cast. Join Urianger at the Sil'dih excavation site, that you may begin the search.

According to Urianger, Y'shtola's trail leads to the Twelveswood, where she likely remains adrift in the Lifestream. He adds that no soul can survive for long in the midst of its restless currents. Realizing the urgency of the situation, Alphinaud resolves to petition the aid of the Elder Seedseer. Make haste to Gridania, and join Alphinaud at Nophica's Altar.

According to Alphinaud, only the elementals will be able to find Y'shtola within the Lifestream. And only their chosen people, the Padjal, will be able to ask this of them.

# Lost in the Lifestream🎧

System Guide

-- Alphinaud is eager to petition the Elder Seedseer's aid in rescuing Y'shtola.

Alphinaud

-- I have already requested an audience with the Elder Seedseer. She will receive us in the Lotus Stand presently. We need but speak with the conjurer yonder to be admitted.

Silent Conjurer

-- The Elder Seedseer awaits. Pray follow me.

Kan-E-Senna

-- Be welcome, my friends, and speak freely. I gather your suit will admit no delay.

Alphinaud

-- It will not, my lady. Pray forgive the abrupt nature of our request, but it is a matter of life and death.

Kan-E-Senna

-- I see... As you say, we must needs act swiftly if we are to free Y'shtola from the ungentle pull of the Lifestream. And as you have surmised, we cannot do this unaided. However...

Kan-E-Senna

-- In requesting the elementals' assistance to find Y'shtola, you must needs be aware of one difficulty─a difficulty born of the fundamental difference between man and elemental.

Alphinaud

-- That being...?

Kan-E-Senna

-- In perceiving the world around him, man relies upon senses such as sight and sound. For the sake of convenience, he gives names to such things as are near or dear to him. Being formed of pure aether, however, such concepts are foreign to the elementals. Instead, they perceive by observing the ebb and flow of the energies of life. So profound a division cannot be bridged with simple discourse. The elementals' voices stir not the air, and thus reach not our ears, while our words are but wind to them. Though we seers can commune with them through feelings, naught that we can impart will serve to aid them in identifying Y'shtola. Nay, they must needs be presented with aether which is akin to hers. If you could but find a family member...

Tataru

-- Oh, I know just the person! Y'shtola has a sister who came to live in Gridania. She told me about her once.

Kan-E-Senna

-- That is most fortunate indeed! Pray seek this sister out, then, and bring her to Everschade. There, we shall petition the great ones' aid in finding your lost companion.

Y'mhitra

-- You and your friends wish a word with me? Well, then...you had better bring your friends with you.

Alphinaud

-- I was not aware that Y'shtola had a family member here in Gridania. How very convenient. Forgive me... I have grown so accustomed to being laughed at by the fates, I cannot help but mistrust them when they smile on us. We must, of course, seek the woman out at once.

Tataru

-- If memory serves, Y'shtola's sister is named Y'mhitra. ...Oh, you know her, do you? Well then, that ought to make things easier! Anyway, she spends most of her time around Apkallu Falls, from what I recall. Let's look for her there!

Y'mhitra

-- Greetings, Luna. What brings you here today? I see that you have companions.

Alphinaud

-- Lady Y'mhitra, it is an honor to meet you. My name is Alphinaud Leveilleur, and this is Tataru Taru.

Y'mhitra

-- So you are my sister's comrades in the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. When I heard that your people were being pursued, I desperately sought to reach Shtola, but all mine efforts were to no avail. Now I know why. A forbidden spell, of all things! That she should be so reckless...  But what's done is done. I thank you for bringing word to me. Needless to say, I should be glad to help. Though we were born of different mothers, our veins course with the same father's blood. I hope that this will be enough for the elementals. Come, let us make for Everschade at once.

Kan-E-Senna

-- Raya-O, A-Ruhn─if you would.

-- Hearken to me, O great ones. Pray give yourselves to the Lifestream, a drifting soul to find.

Tataru

-- Please, Y'shtola... Please come back to us...

Kan-E-Senna

-- There! Now!

(Y'shtola appeared)

Kan-E-Senna

Tataru

-- <sniff> <sniff> Oh, Y'shtola... Just seeing her face again... It's... <sniff> Oh, I've been so worried...

Alphinaud

-- Without the Seedseers' aid, Y'shtola may have been forever lost to us. I shall go to the Lotus Stand to offer them my heartfelt thanks.

Alphinaud informs you that he has arranged an audience with the Elder Seedseer. Speak with the silent conjurer at Nophica's Altar to be admitted to the Lotus Stand.

Kan–E–Senna readily agrees to petition the elementals' aid in searching the Lifestream for Y'shtola. She warns, however, that the beings will need to be presented with aether that is akin to that of your missing comrade if they are to identify her. For a blessing, it would seem that a sister of Y'shtola's has taken up residence in Gridania. Ask Tataru for more information on the woman.

According to Tataru, Y'shtola's sister─a fellow Miqo'te by the name of Y'mhitra─is often seen in the vicinity of Apkallu Falls. Seek her there.

Unsurprisingly, Y'mhitra agrees to cooperate in the search for her sister, and accompanies you to Everschade. A short while later, the Seedseers begin communing with the elementals, and with the ethereal beings' aid, they succeed in plucking Y'shtola from the Lifestream, insensible but alive. Kan-E-Senna duly orders her guards to bear your unconscious friend to the Roost to receive proper ministration. Make your own way there and rejoin Tataru.

Tataru cannot contain her joy at Y'shtola's return, and many happy tears are shed. All that remains now is to pray for her swift recovery.
