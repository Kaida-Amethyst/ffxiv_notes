Estinien

-- Well, what do you propose we do now? I, for one, am intent on continuing to the east...

Alphinaud

-- What is there to be found in the east?

Estinien

-- Nidhogg's lair─the Aery─is said to lie in that direction. And the Eye tells me he is near...

Ysayle

-- You cannot still mean to slay him!?

Estinien

-- You cannot still mean to stop me. I have been true to my word, and aided you in this fool's errand with Hraesvelgr. But your efforts at parley have come to naught, Lady Iceheart. I would see Ishgard saved, and for that, Nidhogg must die.

Ysayle

-- With the tale of our ancestors' vile betrayal yet ringing in your ears, you speak of continuing this war?

Estinien

-- Nay, lady, I would but pierce its vengeful heart. When Nidhogg dies, this war shall die with him.

Alphinaud

-- A moment, Estinien. You yourself spoke of the great wyrm's strength--that you believed him powerful enough to raze your city to the ground. How then are we few to challenge him? Even behind the stout walls of Ishgard--with an army of knights manning the defenses─our victory would be hard-won. Yet you propose to contend with the beast in his own lair?

Estinien

-- (Version I) In close combat, this will afford us an advantage. And if the tales are true, the Warrior of Light has bested many an invincible foe.

-- (Version II) In close combat, this will afford us an advantage. And with two Azure Dragoons working in unison, who can say what might be possible?

-- But such speculation is meaningless if we cannot even find the wyrm. Our first task must be to seek out Nidhogg's lair.

Alphinaud

-- The story of this nation grows bloodier by the moment. Must death always be answered with more of the same?

Estinien

-- Such is the way of things, I fear. I shall consider it a miracle if mine armor is not stained crimson ere this conflict is ended.

Ysayle

-- That I should be blinded by my own lies... Everything I believed... Everything I thought I was... Gone... All gone...

Estinien

-- Leave her. Your words will not reach her now. And we have not the time to wait for her to gather up the pieces of her shattered faith.

Alphinaud

-- Estinien... Pray tell me I am wrong.

Alphinaud

-- Is that it?

Estinien

-- Aye... That would be the Aery. I feel Nidhogg's presence through the Eye─his caustic hatred gnawing at my soul. 'Twould seem the death of his consort has put him on guard. Mark how he wards his lair with tempestuous winds.

Alphinaud

-- A similar barrier once barred our entrance to the primal Garuda's domain...until we discovered the means by which it could be penetrated. Mayhap it is time we called upon Master Garlond. 'Twill be just like the good old days, no?

Alphinaud

-- If our only remaining recourse is to violence, then we should seek out the swiftest path to victory. With every moment we hesitate, Ishgard's prospects grow bleaker.

With your efforts at peace in shambles, Estinien is convinced that Nidhogg must be slain if Ishgard is to be spared. You leave Ysayle and her shattered faith behind, and continue eastwards towards the likely location of the Aery. Defeat any enemies you come across in your search for the wyrm's lair.

You have defeated the hostile dragons. Continue to slay any enemies that seek to impede your search for the Aery.

You are once more forced to slay attacking Dravanians. Remain on your guard as you advance to the east towards Nidhogg's lair.

You have thrown back yet another assault launched by your fanged foes. Speak with Estinien where he gazes out into the skies with a troubled Alphinaud.

You have at last discovered the Aery, but Nidhogg has surrounded his lair with a barrier of impenetrable winds. Fortunately, you are acquainted with a talented engineer who just might be able to solve this tempestuous problem...

-- Estinien would have you enlist the aid of Cid Garlond.

Estinien

-- Hm. A force of sufficient power to break through a primal's defenses might conceivably grant us access to the Aery... ...And I can offer no better solution. Pray consult this engineer friend of yours.

Alphinaud

-- Very well. On the condition that you swear not to lure Nidhogg from his lair in our absence.

Estinien

-- And steal all the glory for myself, you mean? Nay, I am not so selfish as that. Contact me by linkpearl when your preparations are complete, and we shall set forth from Ishgard together.

Alphinaud

-- I suggest we rendezvous back at Saint Reinette's Forum, Luna. From what I gleaned of the Holy See's decidedly ambitious airship project, Cid will still be in Ishgard.

Estinien

-- Go, meet with your engineer friend. I shall remain here and keep vigil over the wyrm.

Alphinaud

-- When last you saw Master Garlond, he was advising the Ishgardians on their ailing airship, correct? In that case, he might still be at Camp Cloudtop. Failing that, we could try the airship landing, or mayhap even the Skysteel Manufactory... But let us not waste time searching aimlessly. Someone in the city is sure to know where to find him. The question is who? Ser Aymeric would seem the obvious choice, but there is no guaranteeing he will be able to grant us an audience at short notice... 

-- Ah, I have it! Count Edmont's youngest son prides himself on knowing all of the Holy See's juiciest rumors. Let us return to the manor and see if Lord Emmanellain is about.

Alphinaud

-- We were fortunate to find Lord Emmanellain at home. Hm! The tavern keeper's loss is our gain.

Honoroit

-- When it comes to--ahem--exchanging information of uncertain origin, Lord Emmanellain is something of a prodigy.

Emmanellain

-- Ah, the hero returns! How goes the fight, old girl? Well, I trust! ...Hm? In search of a “Cid Garlond,” you say? Then say no more! The taverns are full of talk, and the name of said silver-haired genius has cropped up more often than most. I hear he has been tasked with getting that monstrous airship the Holy See commissioned to actually fly. 'Twould seem the project has been plagued with mishaps from the first. In any case, Garlond Ironworks employees are known to frequent the airship landing, and I'll wager their master does too.

Alphinaud

-- The airship landing? Yes, I thought as much. Come, Luna--we must find Cid and trouble him for his expert opinion.

Emmanellain

-- If you do find Master Garlond at the airship landing, I trust you won't forget who told you where to look! Credit where credit's due, and all that!

Biggs

-- If Ishgard comes under attack, we'll have to get out of the city pretty sharpish. Don't much like the idea of leaving a job half-finished, though...

Wedge

-- ...What's that? There are dragons coming? Uh, s-s-sorry! Can't talk now! Have to finish this job and get out of here!

Cid

-- Luna! Alphinaud! How fare you both? Not terribly well, judging by your faces.

Alphinaud

-- Greetings, Master Garlond. I am sure it will come as little surprise when I tell you we have need of a favor...

Cid

-- ...Another wind barrier? And you say it was conjured by Nidhogg? Hm. The Enterprise could certainly take you where you need to go...but she would not fare well against dragons. She's agile for a ship her size─but not that agile. The Dravanians would fly rings around her. And if they took it into their heads to incinerate the rigging, there would be precious little we could do to avoid them.

Alphinaud

-- But there must be something we can do! Some manner of weapon we could employ...? Estinien stands vigil at the edge of the Churning Mists, but we do not know how much longer--

Cid

-- All right, all right, I didn't say it was impossible. I said it was impossible for the Enterprise. We need a smaller boat. Biggs! Wedge! It's time we gave that new toy of yours a proper field test. It's probably best if I let the lads show you. Come on, the manufactory's not far!

Alphinaud

-- Ah, yes--the Skysteel Manufactory. As I recall, this workshop is primarily devoted to the construction of dragon-slaying weapons...

Cid

-- The Ishgardians have granted us the use of a small corner of their workshop─all part of the agreement. I think you'll see we've made the most of the space...

Wedge

-- They all want to build bigger, but we know where the future is headed!

Biggs

-- Our little project's just inside. Oh, you're going to like this one...

Wedge

-- Feast your eyes upon our latest and greatest feat of engineering! We call it a “manacutter”!

Biggs

-- After you put down Gaius, Wedge and me struck out on our own for a bit, and started work on the successor to the Tiny Bronco.

Cid

-- Impressive little thing, isn't she? My talent for ship design has plainly rubbed off on them.

-- They've adapted the principles of corrupted crystal technology, and constructed a mechanism which converts aether from its surroundings into elemental wind. Said wind is then harnessed by the specially engineered sails, providing the craft with propulsion and lift. All in all, a most elegant solution... ...I'm actually a little upset that I didn't think of it myself.

Wedge

-- The design does, however, come with one small flaw...

Biggs

-- The energy conversion ratio's bloody awful. To generate enough power to get you off the ground, you need to be in an area awash with predominantly wind-aspected aether.

Wedge

-- In other words, there are a few places you can fly...and lots of places you can't.

Cid

-- The new Ishgardian airship hasn't left the boys much time for tinkering─meaning it may be a while before this particular project takes off, if you'll forgive the pun.

Tataru

-- Hah...hah...hah...

Wedge

-- Tataru, what's happened!?

Tataru

-- I've been looking all over for you! There's been word from Ul'dah! It's about Her Grace, the sultana!

Cid

-- It seems you're required elsewhere. Leave the manacutter with us. We'll see that she's airworthy and suitably equipped to slice through those winds. You, meanwhile, should concentrate on providing Raubahn and the sultana whatever help they need!

Alphinaud

-- I am as intrigued as you, Luna. Shall we hear what news Tataru has brought us?

Estinien is forced to concede that Cid's expertise may be your only hope of breaking through the Aery's tempestuous barrier. While the Azure Dragoon keeps vigil over Nidhogg's lair, you are to enlist your old friend's aid. Make your way back to Ishgard, and rendezvous with Alphinaud at Saint Reinette's Forum.

You arrive back in Ishgard to find Alphinaud pondering how best to locate the Ironworks' ever-industrious master. Recalling Lord Emmanellain's fondness for gossip, he suggests paying a visit to Fortemps Manor. Make your way to the Pillars, and speak with the young lord.

Lord Emmanellain is only too happy to furnish you with the latest gossip surrounding Cid and the Holy See's ill-fated airship. Make your way to Ishgard's airship landing and seek out your old friend.

You locate Cid at the airship landing, and Alphinaud wastes no time describing your predicament. Wary of pitting the Enterprise against foes as agile as the Dravanians, however, Cid suggests you take a look at his employees' latest project. Head over to the Skysteel Manufactory and speak with Biggs.

Biggs and Wedge proudly display their newest invention─a diminutive airship known as a “manacutter.” As they set about explaining the craft's various advantages and disadvantages, however, the door bursts open to admit a panting Tataru. The receptionist has news of the sultana! Noting the urgency of the situation, Cid bids you concentrate on matters in Ul'dah while he and his engineers continue work on the manacutter.

# A General Summons🎧

System Guide

-- Tataru has news for you from Ul'dah.

Tataru

-- General Raubahn says they may have uncovered the sultana's whereabouts! And he wants you─by which I mean both of you─to go to the Waking Sands right away and help with the investigation.

Alphinaud

-- Come, luna--pressing though Ishgard's plight may be, our presence here will not serve to hasten the manacutter's completion. Let us return to the troubled lands of Thanalan and lend what aid we may. Tataru--have our friends at the Congregation send a message to Estinien. Tell him we have identified a solution to our problem, but that it will take some time to prepare.

Tataru

-- As you wish, Master Alphinaud!

Alphinaud

-- To the Waking Sands, Warrior of Light. 'Tis past time Ul'dah was delivered from this darkness!

Raubahn

-- Thank you for coming.

Alphinaud

-- No thanks are necessary, General. I trust your recuperation continues apace?

Raubahn

-- I cannot complain. Thanks to Higiri and her ministrations, I've regained much of the strength I lost during my imprisonment.

Alphinaud

-- I gather you have made progress in the search for Her Grace.

Raubahn

-- Aye, some good fortune at last. A few days past, Dewlala informed us that a sizable shipment of alchemical supplies had been delivered to the palace.

Pipin

-- With Papashan's assistance, I set out to ascertain the source and nature of the shipment. My inquiries led me to Frondale's Phrontistery. There I learned that an order had been placed for a curious substance designed to sustain patients trapped in deathlike slumber--an invention of the former head alchemist, apparently.

Alphinaud

-- A deathlike slumber...? This cannot be a coincidence!

Raubahn

-- It lends some weight to Dewlala's claims, aye. Her Grace is likely somewhere within the palace--abed but alive.

Yugiri

-- Before making any attempt to extricate the sultana, however, it seemed prudent to learn what manner of substance was used to induce her torpor. To that end, I made inquiries as to the whereabouts of the one most like to have administered it--the lady-in-waiting, Meriel. We sent for you as soon as we learned of her location. All that remains is to apprehend the woman.

Raubahn

-- We shall find our cat's-paw in the Silver Bazaar. But we must tread carefully. The market is not the bustling place it once was, and someone is sure to mark our coming. Should they inform the Monetarists, we'll have a fight on our hands. We must be prepared for the worst─and being short an arm, I thought it wise to take another in its stead. What say you, Warrior of Light? Will you lend me yours?

-- Then I pity the bastard that stands in our way. Come, my friends! For Nanamo...and for Ul'dah!

Alphinaud

-- If one had chosen to entrap the sultana in a deathlike sleep rather than slay her, then one would surely also know of a means to rouse her from said state. There must be an antidote to this poison.

Higiri

-- Raubahn's recovery has been nothing short of miraculous. But I should not be surprised. By his scars, I gather that he has survived many terrible wounds.

Urianger

-- The Dunesfolk have long laced their teas with traces of venom, that they might better survive in a land rife with deadly snakes and scorpions. 'Tis all but certain that Her Grace hath nurtured a similar resistance to such substances... Might not this explain the need for so noticeable a quantity of alchemical supplies? In moderation, full many poisons serve as palliatives, after all...

Yugiri

-- Our target is Meriel, the sultana's former lady-in-waiting─a woman of Midlander heritage. I am told the two of you have met. Our sources indicate that she left the palace shortly after the incident, and quietly rejoined the dwindling population of the Silver Bazaar. I suggest we begin by questioning the market's residents, and confirm that Meriel is still in hiding there.

Raubahn

-- Godsdammit, where is she!? I will tear this place apart if I must!

-- So, Her Grace's poisoner seeks refuge in the Silver Bazaar...

Kikipu

-- Greetings, Luna! What can I do for the Silver Bazaar's favorite adventurer? And what brings you to our lonely little hamlet?

Alphinaud

-- You are Meriel, the sultana's former lady-in-waiting?

Meriel

-- I know no one of that name! Pray excuse me... General Aldynn!?

Raubahn

-- We will have the truth from you, girl...

Lolorito

-- Mayhap 'twould be better coming from me.

Raubahn

-- Lolorito... You'd best talk fast.

Lolorito

-- As you know, Teledji Adeledji's Carteneau Reclamation Bill was no more than a facade--a means to get his grubby little hands on that Allagan monstrosity, Omega. When he learned of Nanamo's intention to abdicate, however, he was forced to amend his plans. Suddenly, assassination seemed the most promising way to further his ambitions. I am told Teledji had discovered a maid in whose veins ran the blood of House Thorne--a new, more pliable puppet to sit the throne. 'Twould have caused an uproar, of course, but few could have contested her claim. 'Twas plain that Teledji's wild machinations had outgrown our ability to control them. So I decided to usurp his scheme, and left the fool to seal his own demise.

Raubahn

-- And what of Nanamo?

Lolorito

-- Oh, I have no desire to harm Her Grace--'twould profit me little to destabilize our government. Thus did I employ young Meriel here to administer a potent sleeping potion in place of a poison. You should know, General, that your dear friend Ilberd was fully aware of my plan. I had him lie about the assassination as a means to prime your rage against Teledji. We weren't entirely sure how you would react, but things went rather better than expected.

Raubahn

-- You conniving little worm... You had your claws in the Crystal Braves before their first recruit had sworn to serve!

Lolorito

-- But of course. When a new game begins, 'tis only prudent to have a piece on the board. Ilberd was mine. Truth be told, a significant proportion of the Braves' initial endowment was also mine. With such large sums moving about, 'twas a rather trifling matter to disguise my own contribution. Ah, Ilberd... I secured his services with a promise to support his cause once my authority had been solidified. I swear, the man thinks of naught but prising Ala Mhigo from the grasp of the Empire. Unlike you, General, the poor fellow seems quite unable to forsake the land of his forefathers. Mayhap that's why he called you a traitor to your people and a disgrace to your homeland...amongst other things. What was it he always compared you to? Oh, yes! “An overgrown lapdog, begging for scraps at the sultana's table!” Oh, how we laughed... Alas, Ilberd's entertaining little outbursts eventually gave way to wearisome tirades, and the zealous brute became rather unruly. I had no wish to see you executed, you understand, but he would not take no for an answer. Rest assured, his employment with me has long since ended. ...Which brings us neatly to the present. What say you, General? Both you and the sultana are alive; we have one corpse and one fugitive; and preparations have been made to restore your good name. Shall we cry quits and start again with a blank ledger? Hm?

Raubahn

-- The hells we will! Do you honestly expect me to forgive and forget? After all you've done!? You're guilty of high treason!

Dewlala

-- Stay your blade, Master Aldynn! You yourself are not innocent! Or have you forgotten your own crime in executing Teledji Adeledji without trial!? Though you acted out of loyalty to the sultana, such deeds are in violation of both the word and spirit of the law!

-- ...If you would, Lord Lolorito?

Lolorito

-- This potion will wake the sultana from her slumber. Consider it a gesture of conciliation. You will find Her Grace resting comfortably within her private chambers. Should you doubt my word, I shall willingly accompany you to the palace as your hostage.

Raubahn

-- I like not your motives, Lolorito...but you saved the sultana's life, and for that you have my gratitude.

Dewlala

-- Raubahn Aldynn, you are hereby reinstated as general of the Immortal Flames! The citizens of Ul'dah shall once more be united under Nanamo Ul Namo, and together we shall usher in a new age of prosperity!

Tataru excitedly explains that there has been a significant development in the search for the sultana, and that General Raubahn has requested your assistance. Travel to Vesper Bay in western Thanalan, and join your allies inside the Waking Sands.

At the Waking Sands, you are shocked to learn that the sultana is most likely being kept in a poison-induced sleep somewhere within the palace. Before any attempt is made to rescue her, however, your allies deem it prudent to track down her poisoner and identify the substance used to taint Nanamo's wine. Ask Yugiri to explain exactly what is required of you.

Yugiri has information that Meriel, the sultana's former lady-in-waiting, is hiding somewhere in the Silver Bazaar. Question the inhabitants of the hamlet, and confirm the reclusive poisoner's whereabouts.

You question the residents of the Silver Bazaar, and learn that Meriel has indeed returned to the market settlement. Search each dwelling, and find the sultana's former lady-in-waiting.

Before Raubahn can wring the truth from the trembling Meriel, Lolorito appears and proceeds to reveal the details of the assassination plot. All of his actions, he claims, were intended to expose Teledji Adeledji, and ensure the stability of Ul'dah. As proof of his good intentions, he then presents the Flame General with the means to rouse the sultana from her deathlike state. Speak with Alphinaud, and learn his thoughts on this most unexpected development.

Though undoubtedly gladdened by the prospect of the sultana's coming “resurrection,” you sense that Alphinaud's presiding feeling is one of relief at the avoidance of a bloodbath. Rather than join your fellow Scion in contemplating how much worse things might have been, you resolve instead to give thanks. It has, after all, been a good day for Ul'dah.

Yugiri

Alphinaud

Nanamo

-- I was having the longest dream...

Raubahn

-- 'Tis time to wake up, Your Grace. Another day begins in Thanalan, and the sun blazes bright upon the sands.

Raubahn

-- Her Grace is awoken. The palace physician assures me she is none the worse for her slumber. I believe Her Grace will soon resume her plans to place the government of Ul'dah into the hands of its citizens. Whatever path she chooses to take, I shall walk it with her. And we shall tread slowly, lest the nation be unsettled in our wake.

Lolorito

-- Her Grace's compassion is a shining beacon to us all...but what our city truly thrives upon is competition. 'Tis in the struggle against our rivals that opportunities are seized and fortunes made. And with the Empire on the offensive once more, now would hardly seem the time to turn our system of government upon its head.

Alphinaud

-- Are you privy to new intelligence, my lord?

Lolorito

-- I would hardly call it new. Remind me: what was the name of that enormous imperial warship which met its end in Mor Dhona? Wait, I have it! The Agrius. Yes, well, 'twould appear that the Garleans have been hard at work on another such vessel.

Pipin

-- How close are they to completing this ship!? Is it operational!?

Lolorito

-- Its maiden flight was a success, I hear. I should imagine Emperor Varis is eager to see how it performs in battle. My lords and ladies, I move that it is time to repair the damage caused by Teledji Adeledji, and prepare our great nation to repel the Empire once more.

-- 'Tis well that the sultana has awoken. The Syndicate yet needs to put its house in order, but 'twould seem the worst of the confusion has passed. Ul'dah has taken control of its future...and I must do the same. I have decided to disband the Crystal Braves. Among the recruits, there were those who supported our order's goals and convictions with all sincerity. 'Tis my hope that these loyal men and women will choose to remain our allies in the battles to come. As for those who sided with the traitor, Ilberd, they shall be hunted down and held to account for their crimes. It is my earnest hope that they will surrender themselves peaceably when the time comes...though I think it unlikely. Ah, my all-conquering Crystal Braves... The model army meant to pave the way for a single, unified Grand Company of Eorzea. That so high an ideal should be brought so low... I need not tell you how deeply the betrayal stung me. Yet I see now that it was mine own naivety and pride which allowed the Braves to fall prey to corruption. As ever, it is to your own shining example that I turn for inspiration. Like you, I mean to stand firm in the face of hardship, and give mine all for the cause. Let us resume the search for our missing comrades, that we might come together to shine the light of dawn across the realm once more. The role of Crystal Brave commander suited me ill, and I shall play it no longer. Henceforth, I shall be no more or less than Alphinaud, proud member of the Scions.

Alphinaud

-- I blush to speak thus of mine inner turmoil... But the fact remains: there is no woman alive in whom I would rather confide. Were it not for your shining example, I might never have emerged from beneath the pall of my despair.

Alphinaud is eager to follow Raubahn back to Ul'dah, and witness the beginning of a new chapter in Ul'dahn history. Make your way to the Royal Promenade and present yourself to Bartholomew.

With Nanamo's recovery, the chaos engulfing the city should finally give way to calm. Unfortunately, Lord Lolorito has worrying news to share. It would seem the Empire has built a warship to rival the might of the legendary <Emphasis>Agrius</Emphasis>. Hot on the heels of this shocking revelation, Alphinaud reveals his intent to disband the Crystal Braves. Inquire as to the thinking behind this momentous resolution.

Alphinaud seems at once embarrassed and unburdened by his outpouring of emotion. What shall become of the Crystal Braves now that their commander is set upon the company's dissolution...?

Alphinaud

Yugiri

Alphinaud

-- Aye, and Ul'dah, too, shall flourish once more. General Raubahn and his colleagues have matters well in hand, I believe. ...Lady Yugiri, a question, if I may. I believe your people have been keeping a close watch on the Crystal Braves. Might you know how things stand at the Rising Stones?

Yugiri

-- Ah, yes, of course. You will be pleased to know that the 3rd Unit Braves abandoned Revenant's Toll when they learned of Captain Ilberd's defeat. The only blue uniforms to be seen there now are those worn by soldiers loyal to you, Master Alphinaud.

Alphinaud

-- ...To me? I see. I am grateful to hear that at least some of our members were true to their oaths. Ere we return to Ishgard, I must go to the Rising Stones and thank these stalwarts for their service. It shall be my final act as Crystal Brave commander. Will you join me, Luna? You were there at the company's inception─'tis only fitting that you be present at its end. And...I would appreciate the support.

Alianne

-- The Crystal Braves may be finished, but the ideals upon which the company was founded live on. They bind us to each other─and to you.

With no word on the manacutter forthcoming, Alphinaud inquires as to the present state of affairs at the Rising Stones. Yugiri replies that the 3rd Unit Braves have abandoned Revenant's Toll in the wake of Ilberd's defeat, and that only soldiers loyal to the Crystal Brave commander remain. Upon hearing this, Alphinaud declares his intention to thank these stalwart warriors, and disband the company in person. It is time to return to the Rising Stones.

Alphinaud addresses the assembled Crystal Braves, and expresses his gratitude for their service. When he attempts to dissolve the company, however, Riol and the others pledge their undying support to both him and the Scions, claiming their allegiance lies with the ideals upon which the company was founded, not the company itself. Ask Alphinaud for his thoughts on this heartening turn of events.

Alphinaud is moved to tears by the unshakable support of his comrades─support he feels he does not deserve. He vows, however, to repay their loyalty through his future actions...
