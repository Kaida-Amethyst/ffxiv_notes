# Moglin's Judgment

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- Chieftain Moglin is ready to pass judgement on your trial performance.

Moglin

-- Luna--if that is what you insist on calling yourself--you have completed the Trials of Trustworthiness administered by the taskmasters Moghan, Mogmug, and Mogwin! During these grueling tests of character, I closely observed your conduct─as well as that of your companions... And...I am decided, kupo! Gather your friends before me now, so that I need not repeat myself...needlessly. Not another word until you have summoned your companions, kupo! I was quite serious about the “not repeating myself” part...

Alphinaud

-- Are these “trials” over, then? My tasks have been little more than household chores... If our hosts elect not to grant their aid after working us like pack chocobos, I shall demand compensation in kupo nuts out of principle. But I hope it will not come to that. Let us hear the chieftain's verdict, shall we?

Keeper of the Entwined Serpents -- 1

-- They had the Elder Seedseer scrubbing and sweeping... The Elder Seedseer!

Keeper of the Entwined Serpents -- 2

-- I never imagined my duties would include tidying up fallen leaves in a moogle village beyond the clouds...

Kan-E-Senna

-- Standing here in Moghome, my thoughts turn inevitably to the legend of Good King Moggle Mog XII, and his seat in the heavens... Like most, I thought it no more than a myth─a story for younglings that grew with the telling. But with every passing moment, I become more certain that we have discovered the origin of the tale. Full eager am I to hear what the chieftain has to say.

Estinien

-- How go your trials, Warrior of Light? I myself have been sent on a number of expeditions to “chastise” the local dragon population. Did not their chieftain wish to avoid inflaming the Dravanians...? Such contradictions aside, our hosts seemed entranced by the height of my leap. They compared me to “Mog,” a lance-wielding moogle warrior of eld who also favored such attacks. 'Twas meant as a compliment, I expect, but I doubt these furry lumps could outleap a karakul lamb, much less a dragoon. Conclude your business here swiftly, Luna--I like not this place.

Ysayle

-- What sorcery is this...? That my heart should stir at mere...fluffiness... Luna! I-I was... No matter. What is it? ...Chieftain Moglin has made his decision? Well, let us not keep him waiting, then!

Kuplo Kopp

-- We've become such friends, kupo! My moogle cousins love to sing and dance as much as I do! ...Chieftain Moglin has finally come to a decision, has he? Well, I suppose I'd better flutter over and see him, then!

Moglin

-- Never have I seen such determined workers, kupo! It would have taken us moons to complete all those dreary chores and niggling errands!

Kan-E-Senna

-- And have our labors proven the purity of our intentions, Chieftain?

Moglin

-- Without a doubt! In fact, there was never really all that much doubt to begin with... You were, after all, already friends with a fellow moogle. But, you see, before any meeting with Hraesvelgr could take place, certain preparations needed to be made... And what better way to help you pass the time than by having you perform all the tiresome tasks that no one ever wants to do, kupo!

Estinien

-- Grrr...

Moglin

-- Ohhh dear... Th-The horn! Bring out the horn! Quickly now! We blow on this wondrous instrument whenever we wish to speak with the great wyrm, kupo. We, uh...we haven't perhaps been treating it with the care it deserves of late (and I think Moghan may have sat on it), so we needed some time for cleaning and polishing (and straightening). No lasting harm done, though! Now, you need simply head to Zenith─the wyrm's dwelling to the west─and give the horn a good toot.

Ysayle

-- We are in your debt, Chieftain. Thanks to your noble gift, we shall finally have a chance to plead our case to Hraesvelgr.

Moglin

-- ...Very possibly, yes. ...But I wouldn't get my hopes up too high, kupo. The old wyrm isn't terribly fond of...um...

Ysayle

-- Your concern is appreciated, but I am quite certain that Hraesvelgr will welcome our overtures.

Estinien

-- ...Should we ever arrive at his lair. Come--we have squandered enough time already.

Kan-E-Senna

-- Chieftain Moglin, we thank you for your gracious hospitality. Though we must soon take our leave, I pray that we may continue to nurture the shoots of this new-sprung friendship 'twixt earth and sky.

Moglin

-- Of course, of course, kupo! Visit us whenever you wish! Consider Moghome your home amongst the clouds!

Alphinaud

-- Well that took rather longer than expected. We can ill afford any further delays...

Ysayle

-- Hraesvelgr... At last, we shall meet again.

Estinien

-- Barefaced little bastards... They have played us for fools.

Kan-E-Senna

-- This journey has provided us an invaluable opportunity. We must cherish and strengthen the new bonds we have forged.

Kuplo Kopp

-- Oh, I have so many wonderful tales to tell my kinsmoogles back in the Twelveswood!

Moghan

-- Thanks for the help, kupo! I doubt I would ever have found time for all those rotten chores! ...H-Hey, it wasn't my idea! If the chieftain had spent a little less time sitting about and a little more time chieftaining, things would never have gotten so messy in the first place! (And he was the one who sat on the horn, by the way.) But now all the errands are done and the horn is fixed, so...all's well that ends well, eh, kupo?

After witnessing your conduct during your grueling “trials,” Chieftain Moglin declares that he has an announcement to make. Gather your companions that you might all be present to hear the moogle leader's decision.

You speak to each of your companions in turn, and inform them of Chieftain Moglin's impending announcement. Return to the center of Moghome, and notify the moogle leader that everyone is ready to hear him pass judgment.

Chieftain Moglin somewhat sheepishly admits that your trials were nothing more than a convenient distraction--a means to keep you and your companions occupied while the moogles repaired the horn required to summon Hraesvelgr. It would seem the mere presence of Kuplo Kopp was enough to dispel any doubts the chieftain may have had regarding your intentions. Trouble Moghan for his thoughts on these questionable proceedings.

Moghan guiltily thanks you for your hard work, but deflects all the blame for the deception onto Chieftain Moglin. Though some of your companions are less than impressed with their treatment at the hands of the moogles, you now have a destination to aim for─Zenith.

# Leaving Moghome

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- Moghan is ready to lead you out of Moghome.

Moghan

-- Well, uh...I expect you're eager to be on your way! ...Did I mention your friend was looking for you, kupo? If not: Alphinaud is looking for you! I'll be waiting just outside, stretching my wings. Let me know when you're ready to depart!

Alphinaud

-- I dare not think how long we have been away from Ishgard. Gods help us if we meet with further delays...

Ysayle

-- It will not be long now, Hraesvelgr...

Estinien

-- What was I thinking, listening to those self-satisfied little... <mumble>

Kan-E-Senna

-- Through our labors, new friendships have blossomed. For this, we must give thanks.

Kuplo Kopp

-- I cannot wait to tell my kinsmoogles in the Twelveswood all about this place! They will be beside themselves with envy, kupo!

Alphinaud

-- To the best of my knowledge, we have all that we need for our trip to Zenith. And I believe the Elder Seedseer and her retinue will soon be making the journey back to Gridania. It would be remiss of us, I think, not to convey our gratitude to them prior to going our separate ways. Shall we?

-- The Elder Seedseer and her retinue will soon be departing for Gridania. Before they do, it seems only right that we thank them for their assistance. Shall we?

Moghan

-- ...Why do I get the feeling my life is in mortal danger? Could it be those berries I had for supper?

Estinien

-- Must we have this creature as our guide? I would sooner flay the thing than follow it.

Kan-E-Senna

-- Alphinaud, Luna--I do humbly thank you for what has been a most enlightening experience. Were it not for your pioneering spirit, the existence of these moogles might never have been revealed to us.

Alphinaud

-- 'Tis we who should be thankful, Elder Seedseer. Were it not for your timely diplomacy, they would never have chosen to reveal themselves at all. And 'twas your presence, Kuplo Kopp, that ultimately won us their trust. It must have taken great courage to leave the sanctuary of the Twelveswood, and we are exceedingly glad that you did.

Kuplo Kopp

-- It was my pleasure, kupo! I've made so many new friends, and have so many fantastic tales to tell my kinsmoogles back home!

Kan-E-Senna

-- And it is to our home that we must now return. May you ever walk in the light of the Crystal, my friends.

Alphinaud

-- Safe journey, Elder Seedseer. We too must be on our way. Hraesvelgr awaits.

Kan-E-Senna

-- Warrior of Light... Pray attend closely to your companion, Ser Estinien─beneath that stoical facade, a storm of anguish seethes unseen.

Alphinaud

-- We have tarried overlong. Let us forge ahead as swiftly as we may, lest Ishgard bear the brunt of the Horde's fury.

Estinien

-- Enough talk. Let us leave this risible place behind us.

Yayle

-- The closer we come to Hraesvelgr, the higher my spirits rise. But is it I who am elated...or Saint Shiva?

Moghan

-- Have you said your good-byes and dabbed away your tears, kupo? Then we are indeed ready to go!

Moghan seems eager to escort you on your way. Confirm with Alphinaud that all of the necessary preparations have been made for the journey ahead.

Before departing for Zenith, Alphinaud insists upon bidding a final farewell to the Elder Seedseer. Speak with Kan–E–Senna, and thank her for her invaluable assistance.

You join Alphinaud in expressing your gratitude to Kan–E–Senna and Kuplo Kopp, before bidding them both a fond farewell. As the Elder Seedseer turns to leave, however, she pauses for a moment to warn you about Estinien's internal unrest. Though you have long held similar concerns, you can think of little to do but nod obediently. Return to the Moghome aetheryte, and let Moghan know that you are finally ready to depart.

You inform Moghan of your readiness to continue on your journey. Zenith and the great wyrm Hraesvelgr await...

# The Road to Zenith

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- Moghan has volunteered to lead you to Zenith.

Moghan

-- As Chieftain Moglin already explained, the shiny instrument we gave you is the best means of grabbing Hraesvelgr's attention. I'll come along, and show you the way to Zenith─that's the big palace where you need to blow the horn. First things first, though, we need to make for Asah. Oh...and watch out for rampaging dragons. Hm, maybe that should have been the first thing, kupo.

Alphinaud

-- The histories make no reference to the existence of these ruins... Curious... Most curious...

Ysayle

-- Do you see that sculpture to the south and west of here? I am all but certain it was carved in the likeness of Saint Shiva.

Estinien

-- Never would I have believed that so much land lay hid above the clouds... Dravania is not as I imagined it.

Moghan

-- Things were a bit bitey for a while there, but I think we've arrived in one piece, kupo. I wonder what has the dragons so awfully snappy... I mean, the bad ones are always bad, but they seem worse than usual.

Moghan has volunteered to show you the way to Zenith, but he warns that the road will not be traveled without conflict. Strike out for the ruins of Asah, and defeat any dragons who take issue with your passage.

You have defeated a number of wrathful Dravanians. Be ready for further skirmishes as you continue on your way to Asah.

Once more, you are forced to slay the dragons who ambush you upon the road. Travel the last stretch to the ruins of Asah, and speak with Moghan.

You have safely arrived in the ruins of Asah after battling your way through the land's inhospitable denizens. Though Moghan seems unsettled by the dragons' unusual aggression, your journey to Zenith is all but at an end.

# Waiting for the Wind to Change

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- Moghan seems fretful about the weather.

Moghan

-- Hmmm...we may have a small problem, kupo. When the winds are high like this, Hraesvelgr invariably abandons his lofty perch and heads to the lands below to hunt. If you tried blowing the horn now, I doubt he'd hear it. I suggest we stop at the clearing up ahead and rest until the wind dies down.

Alphinaud

-- The fates make mock of us. To be so close...

Ysayle

-- And now the very elements conspire to delay our meeting with Hraesvelgr... <sigh> I must be patient.

Estinien

-- Who can say when the weather will turn... I have a mind to make camp.

Moghan

-- This should do nicely, kupo. The winds will likely have died down by tomorrow, but until then, we might as well make ourselves comfortable!

Alphinaud

-- If we must interrupt our journey so close to its end, I suppose this place is as good as any. And mayhap a brief respite from the hardships of the road will help to clear our minds in readiness for the coming parley. Very well, then. I believe a campfire is in order. Leave the gathering of fuel to me─I acquired a keen nose for firewood during my time in the frozen wastes of Coerthas.

Estinien

-- Hmph. “Clear our minds”? 'Tis Master Alphinaud whose mind needs clearing. The thought of meeting a great wyrm in the flesh has befuddled the boy. Did you see him stroll away as if these ruins were not crawling with deadly beasts? Follow him, Luna, and see that the wildlife does not make a meal of our young friend. We will have the camp ready by the time you return.

-- Master Alphinaud's artless quest for firewood is like to get him killed. I suggest you follow after the boy, and see that no harm comes to him.

Moghan

-- You know, Estinien may not be as bad as I thought, kupo. Under all those horrid spikes, he actually has a soft spot for his companions. Just a small one, mind. Oh, and don't tell him I told you, all right?

Estinien

-- Leave the firewood to me!

Ysayle

-- I've prepared some things for a meal. It will be plain fare, but better that than empty bellies.

Estinien

-- I see I was right to worry about the boy's safety. Once Alphinaud returns with the wood, we can see about supper. The ice queen has filled a pot with what looked like stew ingredients, ready for the fire.

<div class="border p-6">
Alphinaud

-- Ahhh...few things compare to the simple pleasure of sitting beside a crackling campfire of one's own making.

Estinien

-- Hah! So speaks the “great explorer.” Until recently, you wouldn't have recognized firewood if it came with kindling and a flint.

Alphinaud

-- 'Tis well you instructed me so patiently, then! But yes, left to my own devices, I would have been compelled to signal to Ysayle with a pile of damp leaves.

-- I was born the pampered son of a Sharlayan dignitary, and, alongside my twin, became the youngest student ever to be accepted into the Studium. How proud I was to match wits with scholars and philosophers... How ignorant of mine own shortcomings... That hubris invited manipulation and betrayal...and led to the downfall of the Scions.

Ysayle

-- We all of us are guilty of similar ignorance. How many men lay down their lives, never knowing what it is that they fight for? Never questioning that which they have been taught to believe? 'Twas only upon meeting Hraesvelgr that I learned the truth hidden within our history. Were it not for that chance encounter, I would never have vowed to tear down the Holy See, and expunge the falsehoods with which it fans the flames of conflict. I would have lived and died in ignorance. That the truth has driven me to do terrible things, I cannot deny, but I would rather sin in the pursuit of peace than imagine myself virtuous for perpetuating a needless war.

Alphinaud

-- If this journey has taught me anything, it is the importance--and difficulty--of holding to one's convictions in the face of failure...of striving always to replace one's ignorance with knowledge.

Estinien

-- You are well on your way, Master Alphinaud. At your age, I was but a fool swinging a spear, with scarcely a thought in my head. Even now, I struggle to acknowledge the misconceptions under which I have labored. Sitting here, amongst these grand ruins, how can I deny that man and dragon once lived in peace? But for all that such an age existed, we are now in a time of war. Nidhogg killed my family, and no quirk of history will exonerate him. I may be ignorant of how the Dragonsong War began, but if we do not put an end to this conflict now, I can say for a certainty that it will only breed more vengeful souls such as mine. In my hands resides the power to vanquish a great wyrm. If Ishgard's survival rests on me wielding that power, I will slay Nidhogg myself...orders or no.

Ysayle

-- Estinien... You gave your word...

Estinien

-- My word is contingent upon the success of our parley. Show me the strength of your convictions, Lady Iceheart. Convince Hraesvelgr of the righteousness of your cause.

Ysayle

-- Doubt not but that I shall, dragoon.

Alphinaud

-- Well...winds willing, we shall have our answers on the morrow. Let us sleep now, and face our fate with the rising of the sun...

To your frustration, Moghan insists that with the winds blowing as they are, Hraesvelgr is unlikely to be found at Zenith. It would seem you have no choice but to make yourself comfortable, and wait for the weather to turn. Join the moogle in the clearing to the southeast of the wyrm's palace, and inquire if there is anything you can do to make the time pass more quickly.

Alphinaud has left to gather wood for a fire, but Estinien seems concerned by the youth's distracted air. Follow after your fellow Scion, and see that he returns safely.

You have slain the creatures lurking in Alphinaud's vicinity. Return to the clearing, and reassure Estinien that all is well.

You and your companions enjoy the warmth of the crackling campfire, speaking of the road you have traveled, and the lessons you have learned. But though shared adversity has brought you closer together, tensions yet simmer between Estinien and Ysayle. You can only hope that tomorrow's negotiations will bring a final resolution to their--and Ishgard's--conflict...

-- Moghan is gazing meaningfully at the path to Zenith...

Alphinaud

-- I trust you are well rested, Luna? Good. If we are to parley with Hraesvelgr, we shall each have need of the full complement of our wits.

Ysayle

-- We must succeed in winning Hraesvelgr to our cause. Lend me your resolve, Saint Shiva...

Estinien

-- Whenever you are ready, Warrior of Light. Full eager am I to gaze upon this great wyrm.

Moghan

-- The campfire was so cozy... I must have fallen asleep, kupo. But do you feel how the winds have shifted!? They will have borne Hraesvelgr back to the skies above Zenith─I'm sure of it! This is your chance to climb to the highest floor of the palace, and summon him with a toot on that shiny horn! So, uh...I-I'll be heading back now, if it's all the same to you. Good luck, kupo! It was nice knowing you!

-- (If back to Moghome) Luna! Y-You're alive! I was worried Hraesvelgr might─ Waaait a moment, kupo. I don't remember hearing any tooting. You haven't summoned him yet...have you? If you haven't, climb to the top of his palace and blow the horn. Oh, and forget what I said. I was rambling. Good luck, kupo!

Hraesvelgr

-- Mortals...why do you disturb my solitude?

Alphianud

-- Hraesvelgr...

Hraesvelgr

-- Thou speakest the name of a creature that but awaiteth the release of oblivion. Leave me...

Alphianud

-- By the Twelve... Mine ears hear the tongue of dragons, yet the meaning rings clear within my mind... How can that be...?

Ysayle

-- Hraesvelgr...do you not remember me? 'Twas I whom you found in Dravania─I who glimpsed the truth. The truth about your past, about Shiva─

Hraesvelgr

-- Do not speak her name, mortal!

Ysayle

-- But speak it I must! I have summoned Shiva's soul from the beyond, and offered myself as her vessel! She has made her heart known to me!

Hraesvelgr

-- Foolish girl. Thinkest thou my beloved's spirit hath descended from the heavens!? That the secrets of her heart are thine to know!?

Ysayle

-- I have surrendered mine to her! Do you not see, my love? I am Shiva reborn!

Hraesvelgr

-- Gullible fool... The Light but illuminated the past for thee, it did not grant thee omniscience. The spirit thou hast summoned belongeth not to Shiva─'tis but a shade conjured by thine own fancy. In an age long past, mine own kin were guilty of like folly. Beguiled by the dark ones' lies, they attempted to resurrect a king amongst wyrms─yet the divinity they called forth merely borrowed the semblance of my fallen brood-brother. Such gods are not summoned, but created. Phantoms spun from the threads of misplaced faith.

Ysayle

-- Then the spirit that answered me...

Hraesvelgr

-- ...Was but thy dream of Shiva. Thy soul hath been corrupted by a deity of thine own making, child.

Alphinaud

-- Be that as it may, Lord Hraesvelgr, Ysayle's desire to heal the rift between man and dragon is real, and it has borne us this far. We would spare both our kind and yours the ravages of this senseless war! Pray join your voice to ours in a call for peace and forgiveness!

Hraesvelgr

-- The tale of thy kind is one of avarice, treachery, and death--and thou wouldst speak to me of peace? Hark thee, mortal, to the naked truth...then tell me thou deservest forgiveness!

-- Twelve hundred years ago, my beloved Shiva's sacrifice served to bring an end to the war 'twixt man and dragon, paving the way for an age of peace and cooperation. Two centuries of harmony were to follow, during which time the Elezen learned much about us, not least that the eyes of a great wyrm are the wellspring of his strength. 'Twas out of the selfish desire to possess this strength that King Thordan then conspired to undo all that our peoples had achieved together. With the aid of his leal knights, that most noble of Elezen lured my brood-sister Ratatoskr into an ambush, and took from her that which he craved. Fain would I strike the image from my mind, yet still the scene doth linger─of my brood-sister's tattered corpse, defiled by her Elezen allies. They had torn out her eyes, and feasted upon them in the manner of wild beasts. Yet that was not all, for from their bloody banquet, the fiends had gained strength beyond that of mortal men... Even now, I labor to comprehend the enormity of their betrayal. Nidhogg was the first to learn of the atrocity, and he took to the skies, hungry for vengeance. But though he slew Thordan and some few of his knights, their fellow butchers knew only too well where to aim their spears, and with now-practiced savagery, they set about my brood-brother, sending him flailing from the field... Such is the truth the Holy See would keep hidden. Such was the beginning of the Dragonsong War. 'Tis a song my kind shall ne'er forget, e'en should ten thousand years pass and Ishgard crumble into dust.

Estinien

-- Your tale bears scant resemblance to the one I was taught. How convenient that it should absolve your kind of all responsibility. But tell me, dragon: why should I believe your version of events?

Hraesvelgr

-- What thou choosest to believe is immaterial. The betrayal that yet haunts mine every waking moment is no less than the truth to my kind. And Nidhogg meaneth for Thordan's people to suffer for this sin till the end of days. That which thou imaginest a war of extinction is but a punishment--a siege of the spirit. Hast thou not seen those who tire of the torment? Those who abandon their own and side with dragonkind?

Alphinaud

-- Ishgard's so-called heretics...

Hraesvelgr

-- Know that all the traitors' progeny bear a trace of Ratatoskr's essence. But a single sip of our blood is enough to awaken it...

Ysayle

-- Then...the seed lies within us...?

Hraesvelgr

-- 'Tis for this reason that those who abandon their loyalties are rewarded with a drink. And thus are they transformed, to join the ranks of Nidhogg's ever-growing army as newborn dragons. One by one, through death or defection, my brood-brother shall account for all of the betrayers' children...

Alphinaud

-- Ye gods... I have borne witness to such a transformation! Looked on as a heretic assumed the shape of a dragon... I imagined it some manner of Dravanian enchantment! But if any Ishgardian, regardless of allegiance, has such potential within them... Twelve forgive us. To think of all the dragons we've slain...!

Hraesvelgr

-- There will always be some, of course, who choose to fight until the bitter end--like thee, dragoon... But struggle as thou might, thy youthful vigor will be spent ere thou reachest two score and ten. And Nidhogg shall remain to torment thine offspring.

Estinien

-- Oft have I wondered why Nidhogg did not simply raze Ishgard to the ground. Now I have my answer. He has no intention of winning the Dragonsong War, for it is no war at all, but vengeance--an eternal requiem sung for his murdered sister.

Hraesvelgr

-- Thou hast the right of it, dragonslayer. Comprehendest thou now the futility of thy quest?

Ysayle

-- I have not come this far only to admit defeat. We can still return the Eye to Nidhogg, and beg forgiveness for our ancestors' crimes. Mayhap our words will sway him!

Hraesvelgr

-- Stubborn child... Thou thinkest in mortal terms. Our perception of time is too broad for thee to grasp. 'Tis a simple matter for thee to offer thine apologies--thou didst not perpetrate the crime. Despite thy visions, the deeds of history seem distant to thee. For a wyrm such as Nidhogg, however, that history is yet part of his present, as fresh as the blood that did gush from Ratatoskr's wounds. How could he not be driven mad? 'Tis only by the calming embrace of Shiva's soul that mine own fury hath not consumed me. But let us speak no more of what is done. My faith in your kind is spent, and I would be alone.

Estinien

-- As predicted, Iceheart's faith in the wyrm was misplaced. Which leaves us with but one recourse. You know I have the right of it, Warrior of Light.

Ysayle

-- What false god is this Shiva? What manner of phantom have I welcomed into my heart...?

Alphinaud

-- Hraesvelgr was every bit as awe-inspiring as I imagined. His voice fairly dripped with power─the will behind his words so undeniable that it transcended my ignorance of the dragons' tongue. 'Tis but a pity that I misliked what he said. <sigh> So far did we travel─even unto the very heavens themselves─only to be dismissed like unruly children. And far from mitigating this...humiliation, the hidden truths we have learned serve only to prove that our grand mission of peace was destined to fail from the first. Nothing will deter Nidhogg from his course.

A well-rested Moghan declares that the winds have turned in your favor. After once more instructing you on how to use the horn to summon Hraesvelgr, the moogle bids you a hurried farewell, apparently keen to return to Moghome. You cannot imagine why. Follow the path to Zenith, and blow the horn on the top floor of the palace.

Hraesvelgr answers the call of the horn, but is displeased to find that his sanctuary has been invaded by the children of man. After scornfully dismissing Ysayle's claims to be Shiva reborn, he rebuffs your calls for peace, and recounts the tale of his brood-sister Ratatoskr's murder and the treachery of King Thordan. Man, he concludes, has brought nothing but misery to dragonkind. With that, the immense creature flies away, leaving you to ponder the cost of Nidhogg's eternal quest for vengeance. Trouble Alphinaud for his thoughts on this ill-starred encounter.

Though Hraesvelgr revealed much that was hidden about Ishgard's bloody history, Alphinaud is crushed by the failure of your mission. With your hopes for peace shattered, it is time to consider more desperate measures...
