## Ready to Fly🎧

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Alphinaud has matters to attend to at the Rising Stones.

Alphinaud

-- I must speak of future plans with the remaining Braves. Any information we uncover on the missing Scions will need to be shared with our allies across the realm─specifically, Urianger in the Waking Sands, and Tataru in Ishgard. While we are organizing our various channels of communication, I would ask that you call upon Master Garlond at the manufactory. I will join you in Ishgard as soon as I am able.

-- I am informed that F'lhaminn and her bodyguards, Hoary Boulder and Coultenet, went missing shortly after the feast. <sigh> Our list of absent friends grows longer...

Yugiri

-- 'Twould seem the Ul'dahns no longer require my services. I shall return to the search for our missing companions...

Cid

-- Luna! How in the seven hells do you do it? I was just about to send for you! We have but this moment completed the manacutter's first successful test flight! A few minor adjustments and she'll be ready to go. While we see to the finishing touches, you might want to pay a visit to Fortemps Manor─a dragoon by the name of Estinien was looking for you.

-- Loitering around here won't speed matters up. Leave the boys to apply the finishing touches, and go and see your friend.

Biggs

-- We've been working on a second vessel while we perfected the prototype. Don't worry─they'll both be able to handle the winds you're expecting.

Wedge

-- So sleepy... Hm? What!? I'm awake!

Estinien

-- You have fulfilled your obligations to the Ul'dahns, then? Mistress Tataru has been keeping me apprised of the situation. Once I learned that these “manacutters” of Master Garlond's were nearing completion, I saw no reason to tarry in the Mists. For the present, Nidhogg seems content to remain in the Aery, plotting his revenge. Might not this be an apt moment to unfold our plans to Ser Aymeric? I think we have kept him in the dark long enough.

Temple Knight Guard

-- Ser Aymeric has been eager to speak with you. Pray proceed.
</div>

‍

<div class="border-4 p-6">
Estinien

-- All stands ready, Lord Commander.

Aymeric

-- Ah, the moment has come, then?

Alphinaud

-- Pray excuse my lateness. I paid a brief visit to the workshop to inquire about the manacutters. The engineers assure me that they are ready.

Estinien

-- The Aery is now but a short flight away. Yet what a long and winding path we took to reach this point. Were it not for Master Alphinaud's proposal, we never would have attempted to parley with the dragons. Though our negotiations yielded little, our expedition with Lady Iceheart taught us much.

Aymeric

-- You took an unimaginable risk... I could scarce believe the tale Estinien told.

Estinien

-- Aye, 'tis true that many of our countrymen would sooner die than join hands with the heretics' mistress, but 'twas through that most unlikely of alliances that we came to speak with Hraesvelgr. 

Alphinaud

-- A conversation that went rather poorly, as I recall. 

Estinien

-- In this instance, the journey was more important than the destination. Had we not slain Nidhogg's consort, Tioman, and put the great wyrm on his guard, the Dravanians would have arrived at Ishgard's walls long ago.

Aymeric

-- Aye, that they would. Full grateful am I for every hour of respite your actions have afforded us. Thanks to you, our defenses are much improved. 'Tis but a pity they won't be enough. 

Alphinaud

-- Thus you believe an assault upon the Aery represents the city's best chance of survival. Is that not so, Estinien?

Estinien

-- I am under no illusions. Nidhogg's might is legendary. But with his eye in my possession, I can stifle his strength at the source. Victory will be hard-won, even so, and I shall be glad indeed to have the Warrior of Light at my side.

Aymeric

-- You shall have my blade as well. There are more of these “manacutters” to be had, yes?

Lucia

-- Lord Commander, no!

Aymeric

-- How can I, a proud knight of Ishgard, stand by and do naught while an outsider risks life and limb for our homeland? I swore an oath to protect this city!

Estinien

-- Pray leave the slaying of dragons to dragoons, ser knight. Your duty to command the city's defense is no less vital. Should we fail, and Nidhogg slip through our grasp, who, then, will hold the walls against him? Will you leave Ishgard in the hands of the Holy See's zealots?

Aymeric

-- There are others─

Estinien

-- Who but you has the authority and the standing to orchestrate a citywide defense? I do not, and neither does the Warrior of Light. That is why it is our place to fight, and yours to remain here, Lord Commander.

-- What, you too, Master Alphinaud? By the Fury... You have shown some promise, but this adversary is far beyond your skills.

Alphinaud

-- Your candor is appreciated, ser dragoon. I shall remain, then, and cheer you from afar.

Estinien

-- Well, my friend, 'twould seem I have discouraged the last of the volunteers, and claimed the task as ours alone. But if any alive can best this wyrm, 'tis surely we two!

Estinien

-- I have pricked Master Alphinaud's pride I fear. But had I been less forceful, the boy would have insisted on accompanying us to the Aery. Do not think me blind to his talent. With a few more campaigns under his belt, I have no doubt that Alphinaud will make a fine field commander. But one does not practice on an adversary such as Nidhogg. We shall be hard-pressed enough without the added worry of carrying a novice.

<div class="border-4 p-6">
Alphinaud asks that you return to Ishgard to check on the progress of the manacutter while he coordinates the ongoing search efforts with the remaining Crystal Braves. Make your way to the Skysteel Manufactory and speak with Cid.

Though confounded by your uncannily perfect timing, Cid is happy to announce the near-completion of the manacutter prototype. Whilst he and his employees make the final adjustments to their latest creation, he bids you visit Fortemps Manor, where Estinien awaits.

You meet with Estinien, who appears to have been kept apprised of recent developments by Tataru. With but a few minor touches to be made before the manacutters are ready to fly, the dragoon suggests that you disclose the details of your plan to Ser Aymeric. Proceed to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly, and speak with the guardsman within to be admitted to the Seat of the Lord Commander.

Alphinaud belatedly joins your audience with Ser Aymeric, and together you recount the long and difficult path that has led you to this point. Having listened to your plans, the lord commander eagerly offers his own blade for the battle ahead, forcing Estinien to remind him of his duties as the city's protector. No sooner has Ser Aymeric relented than Alphinaud moves to declare his determination to join you, only conceding defeat after some typically candid words from the Azure Dragoon. Inquire as to Estinien's reason for denying your fellow Scion his wish.

Estinien acknowledges Alphinaud's potential, but believes the task of defeating Nidhogg will be challenging enough without the need to carry an inexperienced ally. You are forced to concede that even with the power of the Eye, the outcome of the battle is far from assured...

-- Estinien is eager to set forth for the Aery.

Estinien

-- We have tarried long enough. Let us call upon Master Garlond and take possession of the manacutters.

Biggs

-- These little beauties are our pride and joy... And now they're yours! So, uh...be careful with 'em, eh!?

Wedge

-- <yawn> ...I guarantee you won't find any loose rivets--we triple-checked!

Estinien

-- The moment is at hand, Warrior of Light.

Cid
-- Luna, old friend! The 'cutters are ready when you are!

Wedge

-- The finer adjustments cost us a few sleepless nights, but we got there in the end!

Biggs

-- Which means you can get where you need to go. I tell you, these little beauties'll tear through that wind barrier like a cermet drill through cottage cheese.

Cid

-- And that, my friends, is a Garlond Ironworks guarantee!

Estinien

-- You have our thanks. Come, Warrior of Light─the dread wyrm awaits!

The Aery (Description)

Sensing the death of his consort, a wary Nidhogg has surrounded his lair with a wall of tempestuous winds. After calling upon the assistance of Cid and his ingenious engineers, however, you and Estinien are now ready to breach this howling barrier on the wings of their latest airship prototype─the manacutter. Join the Azure Dragoon on this, the greatest of wyrm hunts, and mount a direct assault upon the Aery. Only with the death of Nidhogg can you ensure the preservation of Ishgard...and bring an end to the Dragonsong War.

Manacutter (Mount)

Call into battle your manacutter, a single-rider airship constructed at the Garlond Ironworks.

Supervised (in spirit) by the ever-absent Cid, Biggs and Wedge (with a little bending over by Biggs) put their heads together to create this flight-ready miniature airship, powered by the realm's first corrupted crystal engine.

Estinien

-- Greetings, Lord of Dravania! I believe we have something that belongs to you!

Nidhogg

-- Wicked mortals! I shall melt your flesh, and turn your bones to ash!

-- Thou wouldst use mine own eye against me!? Time hath done naught to dilute thy kind's depravity!

-- I have not forgotten thee, dragoon! Mine essence claimed thee once...and shall do so again!

Estinien

-- No, wyrm! This ends here!

-- You gifted my people a thousand years of suffering. Now I gift you an eternity in darkness!
</div>

‍

<div class="border-4 p-6">
Sylvetrel de Dzemael

-- They are ours, Lord Haldrath... The eyes of Nidhogg!

Haldrath

-- Aye... The wyrm lies broken and my father is avenged. With the wellspring of his vitality thus denied him, Nidhogg shall not linger long in this world. But behold the terrible price we have paid. My sire is dead; so many brother knights slain. We traded our honor for the strength which now courses in our veins. And still we are forced to make such sacrifice.

Sylvetrel de Dzemael

-- But not in vain, my lord. Hraesvelgr is the only great wyrm left in Dravania, and he dares not leave his lair. With Nidhogg's eyes in your possession, who now can challenge the might of Ishgard? Ascend the throne, and take your rightful place as the ruler of our people!

Haldrath

-- Nay, my friend, I must forsake the mantle of king. Though Nidhogg be defeated, his wyrmling horde yet darkens the skies with wings beyond counting. As one who partook of Ratatoskr's strength, it shall be my penance to bear a knight's arms until death grants me leave to retire. When that day comes, no prince shall perish, but a hells-bound hunter of dragons...

Sylvetrel de Dzemael

-- But Lord Haldrath! What then shall become of the royal line!?

Flavien de Fortemps

-- Think of your people, my lord! Without a king, who will the common man turn to in his hour of need? How will he find his way without your benevolent hand to guide him?

Haldrath

-- I thank you, Ser Flavien and Ser Sylvetrel─for dispelling my remaining doubts. With men of such wisdom and compassion in service to the realm, 'tis plain that Ishgard has no need of a king. But if you must bow to the demands of tradition, you need look no further than yourselves for one worthy to wear the crown.

-- Fare thee well, my brother knights...my loyal friends. On these shoulders shall I bear the weight of my father's sins; with this lance shall I repay the debt accrued through our misdeeds.

Sylvetrel de Dzemael

-- What cruel jest has fate played upon us...? Have we seized this desperate victory only to lose a king? 

Flavien de Fortemps

-- We can but act as our lord has bid. We few who remain must divide between us the rulership of Ishgard and her people.

Brawny Knight

-- Not I. My oath was to Lord Haldrath, and he alone. If he is not to be king, then I would hang up my shield, as well.

Sylvetrel de Dzemael

-- Will you abandon us, too, ser?

Brawny Knight

-- I would wash my hands of blood and betrayal and take up an honest trade. Mayhap I shall serve ale instead of sharpened steel...

Flavien de Fortemps

-- We four, then...

Sylvetrel de Dzemael

-- Fortemps, Haillenarte, Durendaire, and Dzemael... But four houses to rule all of Ishgard...

Flavien de Fortemps

-- ...And what of the throne?

Sylvetrel de Dzemael

-- We keep it empty. Until the day a king rises once more, we must assume the role of stewards. We shall shape our nation anew with a history of our own making─and let the truth of this dark day die here, upon the battlefield.

Estinien

-- What ails you, friend!? Are you wounded?

-- You have borne witness to history...to the culmination of the first battle with Nidhogg. The legend of Ishgard's founding tells that our ancestors were led to the land of Coerthas by the valiant King Thordan. In the midst of their journey, they came to a wide chasm, where they were set upon by a great wyrm─Nidhogg. A furious battle then ensued, with Thordan leading the van. Though the brave king was slain defending his people, his son, Haldrath, the first Azure Dragoon, fought on undaunted... And with a mighty thrust of his lance, he gouged out Nidhogg's eye, forcing the wicked creature into retreat. Thus did this eldritch orb become a sacred treasure of Ishgard, lending its power to every knight deemed worthy to bear the title of Azure Dragoon.

-- A rousing tale, is it not? Would that I could still believe it. But your vision, which we must accept as immutable truth, leaves no room for doubt─save on one point. If Haldrath took both of Nidhogg's eyes, then how came this eye to be lodged in the wyrm's skull? Beneath every answer we unearth, another question lies buried...

-- 'Twas a fierce battle, but one I knew we would win. Your fame is well deserved, Warrior of Light. Full proud am I to have fought at your side. I would fain return with all swiftness to Ishgard to inform the lord commander of our triumph... But we must first have words with Hraesvelgr. There are parts of this tale that the wyrm has kept from us, and I would know wherefore...

<div class="border-4 p-6">
With no further obstacles to bar your entrance to the Aery, Estinien is eager to be underway. Return to the Skysteel Manufactory, and collect the manacutters from Cid.

At the manufactory, Cid, Wedge, and Biggs take turns reassuring you that their manacutters are equal to the task of piercing the barrier around the Aery. Seeing no further need to delay, Estinien bids you fly with him to Nidhogg's lair forthwith. It would seem that the time has come at last to face the dread wyrm in a battle that could bring an end to a thousand years of suffering.

Following an aerial encounter with the enraged Nidhogg, you are separated from Estinien and land far from the duel between dragoon and wyrm. Undaunted, you cut a bloody path through the Aery's defenders, and eventually arrive at their master's lofty perch. There, with the Azure Dragoon stifling the source of Nidhogg's strength, you finally succeed in bringing the massive creature down.

Glorying in victory, the Azure Dragoon gouges out Nidhogg's remaining eye, and sends the lifeless wyrm tumbling into the clouds below. Moments later, your Crystal of Lightning is suffused with new radiance, and you are treated to another vision of the past─a vision wherein you witness the truth of Nidhogg's defeat at the hands of Haldrath and his knights. When you subsequently relate the tale to Estinien, the dragoon seems greatly perplexed. If Haldrath claimed both eyes from the wyrm, whence came the trophy so recently plucked from Nidhogg's skull? Discuss the matter further with Estinien.

Though Estinien has defeated his lifelong nemesis, the mysteries thus uncovered weigh heavily upon his heart. Only by wresting the truth from Hraesvelgr will your triumph be complete.

## The Song Begins🎧

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Estinien would know the origin of Nidhogg's mysterious eye.

Estinien

-- With Nidhogg fallen, none save Hraesvelgr remains to answer our questions. Let us trouble the wyrm again. And if Iceheart yet lingers at Zenith, all the better. I would have her hear the truth from the dragon's maw.

-- ...She has scarce moved since last we parted. Hmph. Hraesvelgr's confession will soon shake her from her stupor.

Ysayle

-- 'Twas you, was it not? The furious screams of the dragons carried far... You have slain Nidhogg─what more could you desire from this place? Will you not allow Hraesvelgr to mourn the death of his kin in peace!?

Estinien

-- Spare us your sanctimonious judgment, ice maiden. We have a gift for the great wyrm...and a mystery that can no longer lie buried. Lady Iceheart─the Dragonsong War has all but consumed your life and claimed many of your followers. 'Tis time you learned the truth of its beginning─the whole truth─that we may at last bring this bitter conflict to an end.

-- Sound the horn, Warrior of Light!

Hraesvelgr

-- Impenitent mortals, ever seeking to bury old wrongs under new.

-- I did sense the moment of Nidhogg's demise...

Estinien

-- You mean the moment I prised your eye from his head?

Hraesvelgr

-- 'Twould seem thou hast uncovered my secret. Aye. Unto the blinded Nidhogg did I yield one half of my strength...

------------------------------

Hraesvelgr

-- Nidhogg... What hath befallen thee?

Nidhogg

-- We are undone by covetous mortals. They did take Ratatoskr's eyes...and glut their appetites upon her essence...

Hraesvelgr

-- She is slain, then? What madness hath unmade our peaceful accord!?

Nidhogg

-- Did I not warn thee, brood-brother? They have ever been untrustworthy creatures, these short-lived Elezen. But thou wert enchanted by thy mortal maid. Thy folly hath cost Ratatoskr her life, and me mine eyes...

Hraesvelgr

-- Oh, my beloved Shiva... How swiftly are thy kin made bestial by their appetites.

Nidhogg

-- Hraesvelgr. 'Twas thy blindness that did invite disaster into our lands. Surrender thee an eye to me, and let that be thy penance.

Hraesvelgr

-- Nidhogg...

Nidhogg

-- They bested me once, but I was reckless. I shall need but a single eye to inflict enduring torment upon these traitors and every child of their line!

-- Yield to me thy strength, brood-brother!

-- My vengeance is begun!

------------------------------

Hraesvelgr

-- Thou hast borne witness to a scene from my past.

Ysayle

-- It was yours... Your strength that sustained Nidhogg all these years...

Estinien

-- Would that Haldrath had dealt the wyrm a killing blow...

Hraesvelgr

-- When my brood-brother did appear before me, bloody and blinded, his life was all but spent. He demanded half my vigor, that he might exact his revenge upon the mortals who had wronged us.

Ysayle

-- And so you acquiesced! You surrendered your eye to Nidhogg knowing full well the suffering he would inflict!

Hraesvelgr

-- The peace my beloved so dearly desired had been shattered by her own kin. Their treachery claimed my brood-sister's life and my brood-brother's reason! Thinkest thou thy fits of indignation will move me to remorse!? Go, mortals! Take your unruly passions and leave this place... Your presence here spelleth naught but misery. Were it not for Shiva's soothing embrace, I would slay you where you stand. Woe betide you should the bond we share ever weaken!

It would seem that Estinien cannot rest until he has prised the truth from Hraesvelgr─and he would have Lady Iceheart present to hear the final chapter of the tale. Travel to Zenith in the Churning Mists and seek out Ysayle.

You rejoin Ysayle at Zenith, and once more sound the horn to summon Hraesvelgr. As before, the great wyrm's presence stirs the dormant power of the Echo, and you are visited with a vision from a thousand years past. In the scene which unfolds before you, Hraesvelgr surrenders an eye to his vengeful brood-brother, condemning the people of Ishgard to an eternity of suffering... At last, you know the truth of the Dragonsong War's beginnings.

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Estinien is frustrated by yet another mystery.

Estinien

-- Though he lifted not a single claw, 'twould seem that Hraesvelgr wreaked his own manner of vengeance against us...

Estinien

-- 'Twas my life's goal to slay Nidhogg, but I find there is little joy to be had in its accomplishment.

Ysayle

-- But you have rid the world of a hate-filled creature, and ended a bloody war in so doing...

Estinien

-- I lost my family to Nidhogg's flames. And 'twas with fury in my heart that I took up the lance. Every blow I struck, I struck in the name of vengeance. We were not so different, he and I.

Ysayle

-- I will not judge you for your deeds─I have not the right. Too many innocents have perished in the name of my “greater good.”

Estinien

-- Yet even with all that has passed, the tale is incomplete. We are short a great wyrm's eye. Of the pair which Haldrath took from Nidhogg, only one is known to us─the one I bear. What, then, became of the other? Why did Nidhogg, who had taken such pains to prolong the Dragonsong War, suddenly decide to hurl his entire army against the walls of Ishgard?

-- Lord Commander... Aye, the deed is done. Nidhogg is slain. What? ...In the city!? A battle with whom!?

-- At once, Lord Commander. Hold firm till our return.

-- Fighting has broken out in the city. Lord Aymeric was sparse with the particulars, but it seems some commoners threw open the gates to a force of heretics.

Ysayle

-- I gave no order to attack!

Estinien

-- Are we to mark the end of the Dragonsong War by spilling the blood of our own? Mayhap Hraesvelgr was right about us... Let us away, Warrior of Light. The people must be saved from themselves.

Ysayle

-- Wait! I would join you! There has been enough violence. I will appeal to my people in the city and make them see reason!

Estinien

-- Come, then, Lady Iceheart. Let us write the final chapter in this damnable war.

Zephirin

-- A small army of heretics has invaded the city, Your Eminence. But there is no cause for concern. A sizable contingent of our soldiers is already in place to repel the Dravanian assault, and the intruders will soon find themselves outnumbered and outmatched.

Archbishop Thordan VII

-- Our plans proceed apace, then.

Zephirin

-- Yes, Your Eminence. This unrest shall serve to feed the people's fear of the heretics and the dragons both.

Archbishop Thordan VII

-- And lend renewed fervor to their prayers for deliverance... Very good. Grant our guests what time they need to sow a measure of chaos, then order the Temple Knights to crush them.

Zephirin

-- Your will be done.

Lahabrea

-- The moment is at hand?

-- Excellent. All shall soon be in alignment.

-- It is time for the Bringer of Light to die.

Ysayle

-- Comrades! Sheathe your swords! There is no need for further bloodshed!

Heretic

-- My lady!? She is come!

Ysayle

-- Hear me, brothers and sisters! The war is ended! Nidhogg is no more! 

-- Aye, it is so! This adventurer and the Azure Dragoon laid the great wyrm low! The endless cycle of violence between man and dragon was born of our forefathers' treachery. You have followed me─bled with me─to bring this truth to light, that we might all know peace! But Nidhogg is dead─Nidhogg is dead, my friends! He who bore such hatred towards Ishgard is dead! Let his hatred die with him, I say! Let us sheathe our swords and go in peace!

Heretic

-- Have we lost!?

Ysayle

-- No, my friend, far from it! At long last, the peace for which we have so desperately fought is within our grasp! And I for one would not forsake it!

Heretic

-- Peace...?

Timorous Temple Knight

-- Seize the witch! Let none escape!

Haurchefant

-- Providing aid and succor to the wounded should be our first concern. If the heretics mean to observe the peace, then it would be folly not to do the same!

<div class="border-4 p-6">
Estinien ponders the whereabouts of Nidhogg's missing eye, and muses over the great wyrm's sudden decision to hurl his entire army at the walls of Ishgard. Before he can come to a conclusion, however, the dragoon is interrupted by an urgent report from Ser Aymeric. It would seem that heretics have begun an uprising within the city itself. You return to Ishgard, and, with Ysayle's aid, seek to bring a peaceful end to the senseless destruction.

Upon entering the war-torn city, you are reunited with Lord Haurchefant. He quickly leads you to where a tense confrontation between the heretics and the Temple Knights threatens to explode into further violence. Lady Ysayle then tells her followers of the death of Nidhogg, and pronounces the Dragonsong War to be over. The heretics are thus persuaded to put up their arms, and retreat from the conflict at their mistress's command. Speak with Lord Haurchefant in the aftermath of the uprising.

Though Lord Haurchefant has convinced the incredulous knights to abandon any pursuit, he appears almost equally bewildered by this unexpected turn of events...

## He Who Would Not Be Denied🎧

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Lord Haurchefant has more than a few question to ask.

Haurchefant

-- That, my friends, was rather too close for comfort. Praise Halone that things did not end in bloodshed. I confess, I was more than a little dismayed to see you in the company of the Lady Iceheart. Whatever is going on, Luna? 

-- Beg pardon...? You traveled to the Churning Mists together? ...Along with Estinien!? Never was there a more unlikely alliance--nor one so magnificently effective! Nidhogg, dead; the heretics, pacified--Father and Ser Aymeric must know of this!

Estinien

-- Let us break the news to them together. I will bring Ser Aymeric to Fortemps Manor.

Haurchefant

-- Hmm...yes, an excellent suggestion. Very well. Luna and I shall await you there!
</div>

<div class="border-4 p-6">
Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- Praise Halone, you are safe!

Haurchefant

-- My safety was never in doubt, Father, for I had the Azure Dragoon and the Warrior of Light by my side. We bring the most wonderful tidings!

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- The infamous Lady Iceheart, here in Ishgard? This is most unexpected...

Aymeric

-- She has done much to quell the violence. The inquisition may not approve, but we are glad of her presence.

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- And with the great wyrm's demise, even our nation's more reactionary elements will have scant grounds to press for her immediate impeachment. 

Aymeric

-- My thoughts exactly.

Alphinaud

-- What of the truth revealed to us by Hraesvelgr? That the origins of the Dragonsong War─a core tenet of Ishgardian faith─are quite unlike those depicted in the scriptures.

Aymeric

-- ...That men and dragons once lived together in harmony, and that it was man's treachery which shattered the peace and plunged our peoples into war.

Aymeric

-- The same scripture also describes the origins of the High Houses. Were it exposed as false, the legitimacy of our rule would be called into question. 

-- If both highborn and lowborn can trace their ancestry to Thordan and his knights twelve...

Alphinaud

-- But a single sip of dragon's blood is required to confirm their lineage.

Aymeric

-- If the Holy See knew of this and chose to remain silent, their crimes are grievous indeed. Regardless, this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue.

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- Ser Aymeric! You cannot mean to raise this matter with the archbishop!?

Haurchefant

-- Pray consider what you are proposing! If the Holy See chose to conceal the truth for centuries, what reason would they have to reveal it now!?

Alphinaud

-- At best, you will be branded a heretic and clapped in irons!

Aymeric

-- Then, at least, the archbishop will have shown his true colors. My friends, this war will never truly be at an end until the truth is made known. You must see what lies on the horizon if it is not. When ruled by fear of a common enemy, we were united. But now we have none. During the war, the highborn needed men to lead, and the lowborn, men to follow. Not anymore. 'Tis but a matter of time before the old order is called into question. Lady Iceheart will share the truth with her followers, and the Holy See will be powerless to stop its spread. The disenfranchised will rise up, united, and blood will flow in the streets once more...

-- A divided Ishgard will not survive.

Lucia

-- Tread carefully, Lord Commander...

Alphinaud

-- My lady, is it wise to let him go? I sympathize with the lord commander's desire for reform, but to approach the archbishop in this manner bespeaks an idealism to which I did not think Ser Aymeric prone.

Lucia

-- Though he comports himself as a realist, he has long dreamt of reform. 'Twas that idealism which first drew me to him─that which made me swear an oath to serve. We must not think of ways to hinder his cause, but rather ways to aid it─even should the Holy See cry heresy.

Alphinaud

-- You cannot mean...

Lucia

-- If the lord commander does not return from the Vault at the appointed hour, I mean to go and fetch him.

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- Have care, my lady─your words border on treason! Should they reach the wrong ears, you would be declared an enemy of Ishgard!

Lucia

-- That is a risk I am willing to take. Lest you forget, my lord─I am not born of this land. My loyalty is to the lord commander alone. But I speak only of what may come to pass. If the rumors regarding his heritage are to be believed, we have naught to fear.

Estinien

-- Hmph. Lies and slander.

Alphinaud

-- Forgive me─what rumors are these?

Lucia

-- That Ser Aymeric is the archbishop's bastard son. Senior clergy are not permitted to marry and sire children. But even the holiest among us are not immune to temptation.

Alphinaud

-- I labor to believe it... Ser Aymeric is truly the archbishop's son?

Lucia

-- He has never been publicly acknowledged as such, but the rumors have plagued him since childhood. That he rose to his current position, despite being despised as a bastard, and accused of profiting from his father's influence, bespeaks the quality of his character. It is my hope that on this occasion, the burden of his birth will work in his favor. Should our worst fears be realized, the archbishop will not be so quick to execute his own flesh and blood, affording us time to mount a rescue.

Estinien

-- Bastard or trueborn, he is our nation's best hope. If the Holy See dares to threaten him, I shall lead the charge against the Vault myself.

Haurchefant

-- Hear, hear! The future of Ishgard rests on Ser Aymeric's shoulders! I too will do mine utmost to aid his cause!

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- Haurchefant, be reasonable...

Haurchefant

-- A knight lives to serve, Father─to aid those in need! The people need Ser Aymeric─more than ever─and we may be his only hope! There is no greater calling for a knight than to save the life of his fellow man. I swear to you, on the sigil of our house, that I shall do this and make you proud.

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- Even you? <sigh> Romantic, reckless fools, the lot of you. So be it─make your preparations.

Lucia

-- I thank you all for your support.

Alphinaud

-- Far be it from me to criticize a man for his blind idealism--but he might at least have pretended to consider another course.

Estinien

-- Hmph. Of all the people... He should know better.

Haurchefant

-- Have no fear, Father! My arm will not falter; my shield will not break. I promise you: we shall prevail!

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- If we must risk the fortunes of our house to bring this truth to light, then so be it. But are you truly prepared to do this? To face the Heavens' Ward in battle, if you must?

Lucia

-- Though your assistance is most welcome, I fear it will not be enough. Few as we are, we will struggle to reach the lord commander. If we are to succeed, we must needs recruit others to our cause.

Lord Haurchefant listens with increasing incredulity as you recount your journey to the Churning Mists with Estinien and Ysayle. Yet the fruits of this unlikely alliance are there for all to see: Nidhogg has fallen, and the heretics have quit the city in peace. Keen to break the news to his father and Ser Aymeric, Haurchefant bids you join him at Fortemps Manor.

Though glad of your victory, Count Edmont and the others are deeply troubled by the revelation that the Ishgardian faith is built upon a lie. Overcome with emotion, Ser Aymeric leaves to confront the archbishop with the truth, despite the others' warnings that he is certain to be branded a heretic for his trouble.

Though all present are doubtful as to the wisdom of Ser Aymeric's plan, Lucia is determined to support her commander, going so far as to contemplate his rescue. She proceeds to reveal that Ser Aymeric is the illegitimate son of Thordan VII--a fact she hopes will serve to stay the archbishop's hand. Fearing the worst, however, you join Alphinaud, Estinien, and Lord Haurchefant in volunteering to assist Lucia should the lord commander be taken prisoner. Find out how she means to proceed.

While grateful for your assistance, Lucia believes it will not be enough. To be assured of success, you will need to enlist the aid of others. But who?
