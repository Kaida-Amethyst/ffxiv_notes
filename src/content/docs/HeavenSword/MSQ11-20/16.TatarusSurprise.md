# Tataru's Surprise🎧

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Tataru needs you to fetch a few items for a crafting endeavor.

Tataru

-- Y'shtola is resting within an inn room. Though she's still unconscious, the signs are positive. The conjurers say she is in sound health and should awaken before long! Isn't that wonderful? Now, while we wait for Y'shtola to wake up, I thought I'd take the opportunity to finish my little surprise for her. It's something I've been working on for a while now, in the hope that she'd one day return to us. It wants for just a couple more items before it's ready. I've already placed orders for these items. Could I ask you to retrieve them for me? One is with the Leatherworkers' Guild and another is with the Conjurers' Guild. Speak with Mistress Geva and Brother E-Sumi-Yan, and they ought to take care of you!

Geva

-- Well, if it isn't Luna. Looking for some hides to tan, mayhap? 

-- ...Hm? Here to retrieve an order for Mistress Tataru, you say? You come at a good time─I finished it but moments ago. It was no small coup working it to her specifications, but I did it nonetheless. Payment has already been settled. However did that girl come by chimerical hide, anyway? You need either balls of steel or a bottomless coinpurse, and it seemed to me she had neither.

E-Sumi-Yan

-- Greetings, Luna. I trust you have been well. Is there aught you require of me?

-- Ah, yes, Mistress Tataru's order. As requested, it has been sanctified in the sight of the elementals. I know not what she intends for the staff, but it is a most singular artifact. Even one possessed of my experience would struggle to wield it.

Alphinaud

-- The Seedseers are gracious souls. It gives me heart to know that they are our allies.

Tataru

-- Ah, you're back! You have the items, I hope? ...Oooh, it's precisely as I requested─a perfect match for the other pieces! Truly, Geva is a master among masters! And the staff completes the surprise! Thank you so much, Luna. Tee hee, I can't wait to see what Y'shtola thinks of the surprise! Lest you wonder, she's doing very well, and the conjurers have left her in her sister's care. Let's go and pay them a visit, shall we?

Tataur

-- Y'shtola! I'm so glad you're back!

Y'shtola

-- Tataru...

Alphinaud

-- You are safe... Thank the Twelve.

Y'shtola

-- Something has changed about you, Alphinaud. Or mayhap the change is with me? I seem to sense the aether around me more keenly than before.

Alphinaud

-- I am pleased to see you well again. Do you feel strong enough to talk?

Y'shtola

-- Worry not. I am well enough.

Alphinaud

-- Tell us, then─what befell you after you fled the feast? We were told that there had been a tunnel collapse.

Y'shtola

-- That was my doing. I brought the tunnel down that you and Minfilia might escape. At the last moment, I invoked a teleportation magick in hopes of spiriting Thancred away, at least. Needless to say, it did not go quite as planned, and I found myself adrift in the Lifestream.

-- The others─where are they? Did they not escape?

Alphinaud

-- They remain unaccounted for. You are the only one we have been able to find. I am truly sorry. It was the Crystal Braves who pursued you that day─my hubris that led to our undoing.

Y'shtola

-- No apologies are necessary, Alphinaud─you are not to blame for what occurred. Know that were our comrades here, they would commend you for keeping the light of hope alive.

Tataru

-- Don't...don't worry! The others are alive and well, I'm sure of it! We just need to find them!

Alphinaud

-- Indeed, Tataru. Let us find our friends and rebuild the Scions.

Y'shtola

-- Ha! There is the Alphinaud I remember─and I feel much the better for his return! 'Tis time I arose!

Tataru

-- That reminds me! I have a change of clothes for you! I don't like to boast, but I made them myself. I learned how to weave while we were in Ishgard, you see.

Y'shtola

-- Tataru has apprised me of all that took place in the aftermath of the assassination plot. It would seem I have been away for some while.

Alphinaud

-- Yes, much and more happened during your absence. At present, we seek to follow the archbishop to Azys Lla.

Y'shtola

-- And you want for some manner of aetheric ram to pierce the floating isle's protective barrier.

Alphinaud

-- We do. Might you be able to furnish us with one?

Y'shtola

-- A means to prise open a hole in an Allagan barrier─and one large enough to admit an airship, no less... Hm... Nay. I lack the knowledge to devise such a weapon.

-- ...But I know of one who could. A leading figure in the field of aetheric research, and one of the finest scholars ever to grace Sharlayan─Matoya, my former master.

-------------------------------

Alphinaud

-- Matoya... The name rings strangely familiar.

Tataru

-- Tee hee! Y'shtola looks absolutely smashing in her new outfit, don't you think?

Tataru has been preparing a surprise for Y'shtola in anticipation of her return, and needs your help to finish it. She bids you retrieve two items in her stead─one from Geva at the Leatherworkers' Guild, and another from Brother E–Sumi–Yan at the Conjurers' Guild.

You have obtained the two items Tataru requested. Deliver them to her at the Carline Canopy.

Tataru receives the two items with thanks, and together you go and pay Y'shtola a visit. You arrive at the inn room to find your comrade awakened, and a touching reunion takes place. Back on her feet and briefed on the situation, Y'shtola flatly states that she lacks the knowledge to build an aetheric ram. However, she knows someone who could: her former master, Matoya.

# Onward to Sharlayan

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Y'shtola wishes to tell you more about her former master, Matoya.

Y'shtola

-- In my youth, I had the honor of studying under Matoya. In the field of aetheric research, she was without rival. I have no doubt that her knowledge will be of aid to our cause. The question is, will she share it with us? My master has ever been willful─the gods forbid anyone disagrees with her. When the Garlean Empire first marched upon Eorzea some fifteen years ago, the denizens of Sharlayan were summoned back to the motherland. However, Matoya refused to join the exodus. To this day, she lives a hermit's life on the fringes of the abandoned city.

Alphinaud

-- So it is to the Dravanian hinterlands that we must go. To the place of my birth... Though Alisaie and I were born in Sharlayan, our days there were short. We remained only until the exodus, and I have not returned since.

Y'shtola

-- Oh, so it's to be a homecoming, then? As fine a reason as any to go to Sharlayan, and it would afford us the opportunity to pay my master a visit.

Alphinaud

-- Ahem. I believe you have mistaken our primary objective, Y'shtola. At any rate, the journey will take us through largely unknown territory. Let us first return to Ishgard and make our preparations.

Tataru

-- We managed to find Y'shtola. Given time, I'm sure we'll be reunited with the others as well!

Y'shtola

-- So this is the Holy See. I should like to linger awhile and take in the sights, but it must wait till after our mission.

Alphinaud

-- Sharlayan is situated in the Dravanian hinterlands. To get there, we must strike west and traverse the breadth of the Dravanian forelands. Make no mistake, it will be a grueling journey. The party shall be comprised of Luna, Y'shtola, and myself. Tataru, pray remain in Ishgard and continue the search for our missing friends.

Tataru

-- Yes, sir!

Alphinaud

-- First, let us make for Tailfeather.

----------------------

(Pay a visit to Tataru immediately and find that she has changed her outfit, which almost makes the Warrior of Light suspect that her PC is broken.)

Tataru

-- What do you think of my hair, Luna? Goes well with my garbm does it not? Oh, and did I mention that I made the grad myself? Because I did! Hee hee!

Alphinaud

-- When last we set foot here, Estinien and Ysayle were with us. Though it was not all that long ago, I find myself strangely taken by nostalgia.

Y'shtola

-- A long soak in the Lifestream followed by a long journey... I would not recommend it to anyone. But rest assured my strength is returning to me. I shall be back to my former self ere long.

According to Y'shtola, Matoya has been living as a hermit on the fringes of Sharlayan, in the Dravanian hinterlands. The journey will take you west through the Dravanian forelands. In order to prepare, Alphinaud suggests that you first return to Ishgard. Make your way back to the Holy See, and rejoin your comrades at the aetheryte plaza.

It is decided that you and Alphinaud will accompany Y'shtola on the expedition to Sharlayan. The first leg of your journey will take you to the settlement of Tailfeather.

You have arrived in Tailfeather. The Dravanian hinterlands are now but a short distance away.

# A Great New Nation

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Y'shtola is ready to press on westward to the Dravanian hinterland.

Y'shtola

-- I believe I am sufficiently rested. Let us continue west to Sharlayan. Once we descend the mountain path, we will arrive at the Dravanian hinterlands. From there, it is but a short distance to the city. Be warned that we shall be passing through Gnath territory. We must needs be wary of them and the dragons both.

(After a wearying journey on foot, you, Alphinaud, and Y'shtola finally reached the expanse of the Dravanian hinterland.)

Y'shtola

-- Matoya dwells on the far side of the Thaliak River. Let us search for a crossing.

-- The bridge ahead is collapsed; I am afraid we shan't be crossing there. But worry not, I know another way.

-- See you the towering structure to the north? We should be able to cross there.

Alphinaud

-- But fifteen years abandoned, and already Sharlayan has fallen into such disarray... Verily, a city is no more than its inhabitants.

(Enduring yet another arduous trek, traversing the vastness of the Dravanian hinterland to reach the far bank of the river, you finally arrive at Idyllshire, the long forsaken hamlet.)

Y'shtola

-- “Knowledge Seeks No Man”... So says the motto of Sharlayan engraved upon yonder stone. The meaning is simple: it falls to us to seek enlightenment. During the Sixth Astral Era, at the turn of the thirteenth century, men from the northern nation of Sharlayan journeyed across the seas to Eorzea in search of knowledge. Upon arriving at these shores, they established a camp for their scholarly endeavors. Over time, this camp grew into a settlement, and the settlement prospered, and so much so that it came to be counted amongst Eorzea's great city-states. Alas, those glory days are now but a fading memory. With her keepers lost to her, Sharlayan has become an empty husk of her former self.

Slowfix

-- Pshkohhh... Uplander is mistaken. Sharlayan has new keepers, is on cusp of new age of glory!

Alphinaud

-- Goblins? Here to plunder the city!?

Slowfix

-- <gasp> Uplander is mistaken muchly! We are not thieves! This place is our home!

Y'shtola

-- Your home? When last I looked, it was mine and Alphinaud's. We were born here.

Slowfix

-- Pssshmph! When uplanders abandoned city, uplanders gave up claim. Born here or no, uplanders are trespassers!

Alphinaud

-- My friends, please. We did not come to dispute your claim to this land. Our purpose here is peaceful: we desire but to cross the river. Be calm, I beg you, and let us speak like the civilized folk that we are. Surely we can come to a mutual understanding.

Slowfix

-- Pssshkoh... If that is truth, then uplanders are welcome here. Come with Slowfix─Slowfix will show uplanders settlement.

Y'shtola

-- I suppose it's only to be expected that others would come and occupy Sharlayan. Nonetheless, it feels akin to having strangers take over your home in your absence.

Alphinaud

-- From the goblins' perspective, such a well-appointed city is certainly an attractive proposition.

Slowfix

-- Pshkohhh... Here is heart of settlement, name of Idyllshire!

Midnight Dew

-- What've we got here? Guests?

Alphinaud

-- Greetings to you. I am Alphinaud Leveilleur, and may I introduce my companions, Luan Kali and Y'shtola. We have journeyed far in search of a friend, and seek to cross the river.

Slowfix

-- But findin' the main bridge collapsed, you went lookin' for a detour, and ended up stumblin' into Slowfix and his crew. Is that right?

Y'shtola

-- That is the short of it, aye. This place, Idyllshire─I came expecting a ghost town; suffice it to say I am surprised to find it so alive.

Midnight Dew

-- Well, with all them precious artifacts lyin' about, 'twas only a matter of time afore treasure hunters like me moved in. But we weren't the first to arrive, neither. By then, Slowfix and his gobbie friends were already settled.

Slowfix

-- At first, gobbies and hunters disliked each other. But understanding came, then friendship. Now gobbies and hunters have joined hands to build great new nation!

Y'shtola

-- So that is what happened after we Sharlayans departed...

Midnight Dew

-- Oh, so you're locals...? Um, no hard feelin's, I hope? All these nice buildings, but no one to live in 'em─felt like a waste, you know? We've been tryin' to put the place to rights, and things've been goin' well for the most part, but it ain't all smooth sailin'. Not to sound ungrateful, but the traps your people left lyin' about are a bloody nuisance. And there's the Illuminati harryin' us day and night...

Slowfix

-- Pshkohhh, Slowfix has bright idea! Uplanders desire mutual understanding, yes? Best way to understanding is helping one another! Help citizens of Idyllshire, and uplanders can be citizens too! Citizens are free to cross river!

Alphinaud

-- Well, I am not aware of a quicker way to reach our destination. Let us assist Slowfix and his people.

```plaintext
The Dravanian hinterlands lie west of Tailfeather, and getting there requires that you travel through Gnath-held territory. Proceed with caution as you continue on your way to Sharlayan.

You have arrived in the Dravanian hinterlands. According to Y'shtola, Matoya dwells on the other side of the Thaliak River. Look for a place to cross to the opposite bank.

As you make your way through the ruins of Sharlayan, you encounter a band of goblins. The confrontation threatens to turn violent, but Alphinaud manages to defuse the situation by convincing the goblin leader, Slowfix, that your purpose is peaceful. In an abrupt change of tone, Slowfix offers to take you on a tour. Follow the goblin to the heart of the settlement and speak with him there.

You learn that the goblins mean to found a new nation here in Sharlayan, aided by treasure hunters who have come seeking the city's artifacts. In exchange for passage through the settlement, Slowfix asks that you help the denizens of Idyllshire with the myriad problems they face. For want of an alternate way to cross the Thaliak River, you decide to oblige the goblin.

# Golems Begone

System Guide

-- Slowfix wants you to eliminate the golems that prowl Idyllshire.

Slowfix

-- Pshkohhh... So uplanders agree to help? Good! Here is what Slowfix wants uplanders to do. Many golems prowl Idyllshire, get in the way of expansion plans. Slowfix wants uplanders to eliminate golems. Uplanders are Sharlayan, yes? Sharlayans should know best way to deal with creatures.

Alphinaud

-- Sentinel golems? I daresay Y'shtola will know how to deal with them.

Y'shtola

-- So we are to eliminate the golems. That should be a simple enough affair. The automata were employed as sentinels, and by design can be unmade with a coded command. At the time of the exodus, it was “Noughts and Crosses,” and I see no reason why it should not still work. Let us divide the task between the three of us, the quicker to be finished with it.

Alphinaud

-- I shall see to the golems beyond this point. The area yonder, I leave in your capable hands.

Y'shtola

-- Use the coded command “Noughts and Crosses” to unmake the golems. If all goes well, we can accomplish the task without recourse to violence.

System

-- With the chat mode in Say, use your keyboard or the software keyboard to enter the coded command “Noughts and Crosses” to unmake a golem.

(Beholding a formidable golem, you dash towards it, confronting the creature head-on, and with an impassioned cry, invoke the sacred words: 'Naughts and Crosses!' In an instant, the golem shatters into countless fragments, crumbling before your very eyes)

Golem sentinels left by the Sharlayans are hampering Slowfix's plans for expanding Idyllshire, and the goblin asks that you eliminate them. As a native of Sharlayan, Y'shtola may know an easy way to deal with the creatures.

Y'shtola shares with you the coded command required to unmake the golems. With the chat mode in "Say", use your keyboard or the software keyboard to inform each golem that you want to play a game called “Noughts and Crosses.”

You have unmade all the golems in your assigned area. Return to Slowfix with the good tidings.

You report the completion of your task to Slowfix. The goblin is pleased to hear that the golems will no longer impede the expansion effort.

Alphinaud

-- ...Another favor, you say?

Slowfix

-- Short time ago, dear friend of Slowfix ventured into Illuminati territory. Illuminati are nasty goblins, show no mercy even towards gobbiekin. Slowfix fears for friend's life. Please find friend before Illuminati do.

Y'shtola

-- I am suddenly taken by a sense of foreboding.

Alphinaud

-- Be that as it may, we cannot turn a blind eye. Let us make haste and find Slowfix's friend.

Quickthinx Allthoughts

Y'shtola: I shall invoke a spell!
Y'shtola: Pray keep the enemy at bay!
Y'shtola: It...it is done...

Brayflox Alltalks

-- Psssheehee! Illuminati no match for furious gobfists of Brayflox!

-- More junk is awaiting Brayflox muchly! Brayflox is taking leave of uplanders!

Alphinaud

-- So that was the famous Brayflox... I have newfound respect for the Company of Heroes. That a motley crew such as theirs could achieve the feats they did bespeaks unwavering solidarity.

Y'shtola

-- Being embroiled in a cheese war was the last thing I expected coming to Sharlayan. At any rate, we have fulfilled Slowfix's request. Let us return with the good tidings and be on our way.

Alphinaud

-- I had known that Y'shtola was capable, but to invoke such potent magicks so effortlessly... I must needs redouble my efforts if I am to approach her level of mastery.

Y'shtola

-- One does not simply “drift” in the Lifestream; it is a constant struggle to hold on to your very essence. The experience has hardened me in ways I can ill explain.

Slowfix

-- Uplanders are back! Did uplanders find friend of Slowfix? Pshkohhh... Time has not cured recklessness of Brayflox. Without help from uplanders, Brayflox would now be dead gobbie. Slowfix owes uplanders debt of gratitude! Slowfix and Brayflox are joined by unseverable gobbiebond. If Slowfix had known that uplanders are friends of Brayflox, Slowfix would have welcomed uplanders to gobbieflock at first meeting!

Though you have already fulfilled your part of the bargain in eliminating the golems, Slowfix begs you to oblige him one more favor: rescue his friend who has ventured into Illuminati-held territory. Make your way to the Makers' Quarter and find the reckless goblin before it is too late.

Slowfix's goblin friend is revealed to be none other than Brayflox; no sooner do you locate her than Illuminati forces appear, bent on bloody retribution for their stolen cheese recipe. Together with Alphinaud and Y'shtola, you succeed in putting the enemy to rout, and Brayflox resumes scavenging for junk without skipping a beat.

Whatever the feud between Brayflox and the Illuminati was about, the end result is that you have fulfilled Slowfix's request. Return to Idyllshire and report your success to the goblin.

Slowfix thanks you profusely for rescuing Brayflox. Her antics, it would seem, are considered offbeat even by goblin standards.

# Leaving Idyllshire

```plaintext
System Guide

-- A grateful Slowfix is ready to grant you your heart's desire.

Y'shtola

-- 'Twould be an understatement to say that I am quite ready to move on.

Alphinaud

-- Let us hope there are no further surprises.

Slowfix

-- Pssshkoh... Uplanders have upheld bargain most highly. As promised, Slowfix makes uplanders honored citizens of Idyllshire, free to cross river at will. Though uplanders must leave for now, Slowfix hopes that uplanders will pay many visits and help build great new nation!

Alphinaud

-- You are most kind, my friend. You may be certain that we will return.

Y'shtola

-- I must confess, at first it upset me to learn that my home had been occupied by others. But I see now that it is in good hands. Under your care, I look forward to seeing Sharlayan thrive once more, to become a home to people of all races and creeds.

Slowfix

-- Slowfix has already ordered the gobwatch to let uplanders through. Safe travels!

Y'shtola

-- Alphinaud, Luna--Shall we, then?

Y'shtola

-- I shall be very cross if we are asked to clear this mountain of rubble.

Alphinaud

-- So we are free to go...where exactly?

Gobwatch

-- Pshhh... Shkohhh... By order of Chief Slowfix, uplanders can come and go at will. One moment for clearing away barricade.

Y'shtola

-- Finally, we can continue our journey.

(Suddenly, you catch a glimpse of the Gobwatch swiftly darting to the other side. As you cast a curious gaze behind you, you are astonished to find a line of bombs in your back! Your surprised eyes turn towards Alphinaud and Y'shtola, only to discover that they too have hurriedly crossed to the other side, leaving you behind. Without hesitation, you must follow in their footsteps. Although you manage to escape the misfortune, the thunderous sound of the bombs leaves you gasping for breath.)

-- Ahem. Barring any misadventure, we shall soon arrive at the cave where Matoya resides. Unless you have unfinished business in Idyllshire, let us strike out at once.

Alphinaud

-- I am ready whenever you are. Let us go and meet the legendary Matoya.

Y'shtola

-- Ahead lies the Answering Quarter, where the scholars of Sharlayan gathered to hone their knowledge. Even from this distance, 'tis plain that much of it has been given back to the wilderness.

Alphinaud

-- But the final leg of our journey remains. Let us go and meet the legendary Matoya.

The gobwatch has cleared your path of rubble. Speak with Y'shtola to learn about your next destination.

According to Y'shtola, Matoya's Cave is but a short distance away. The end of your journey is in sight.
