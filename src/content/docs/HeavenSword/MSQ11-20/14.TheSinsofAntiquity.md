-- Alphinaud is lost in thought.

Alphinaud

-- I... We must press on with our mission. Tataru, pray return to your duties at the Forgotten Knight. Let us go and speak with Ser Aymeric, Luna. I worry for his well-being.

Temple Knight Guard

-- An audience with the lord commander? Yes, yes of course...

Estinien

-- Curse those bloody whoresons and piss on their swiving round table.

Aymeric

-- My friends. I am in your debt.

Alphinaud

-- Think nothing of it. Your wounds are healing well, I trust?

Aymeric

-- Some wounds do not heal...

----------------------------------

Aymeric

-- The founding, the scriptures─a thousand years of lies─all to deceive the common man! Nay, our own brothers and sisters─for the blood of the knights twelve flows within all our veins! You knew this to be true. You knew and you concealed it!

Archbishop Thordan VII

-- I should be interested to hear how you came by this knowledge. But yes, you have the right of it. The architects of Ishgard, King Thordan and his knights twelve, entrapped and butchered the great wyrm Ratatoskr, that they might partake of her eyes, and thereby transcend their mortal limits. Upon learning of their treachery, Nidhogg was consumed with a murderous─and justified─rage. I daresay you know what followed...

Aymeric

-- The great wyrm slew the king and half of his knights.

Archbishop Thordan VII

-- Aye...but Nidhogg was subdued, and his eyes plucked from their sockets by the knights that remained. Their one mistake was to show mercy, for from his brother Hraesvelgr did Nidhogg receive a new eye, thus rejuvenating his form and empowering him to embark upon an eternal quest for vengeance.

Aymeric

-- ...Whilst Thordan's son Haldrath took one of Nidhogg's eyes and learned to wield its power in defense of his people...

Archbishop Thordan VII

-- Thus was the first Azure Dragoon born. And ever since that time, his honored successors have risen to drive Nidhogg from our lands whenever the wyrm has returned to plague us.

Archbishop Thordan VII

-- I ask you, my son: will you answer for my sins? Will your son and his son answer for me as well?

Aymeric

-- What do you mean?

Archbishop Thordan VII

-- If a man cannot atone for his sins in the course of his all-too-fleeting life, must his progeny then be held to account? Must every subsequent generation be judged as well? Thordan's betrayal of Ratatoskr was an unconscionable, unforgivable sin. Should we, then, as his descendants, meekly surrender ourselves to an eternity of punishment?

-- Nay, say I. I would not see our children sacrificed in a vain attempt to appease an implacable foe. Dragons are not like us, my son. To they who live forever, the wrongs of antiquity are as those of yesterday. No reparations shall ever suffice. This fact alone should serve as ample justification for our actions, yet some refuse to see it as such. For men like you, who yearn to commit themselves to a nobler cause, a more compelling narrative is required.

Aymeric

-- This is your solution!? This is how you protect our people? You have given us a lost cause! A death sentence! With your compelling narrative, you but doom our countrymen to give their lives for a lie!

Archbishop Thordan VII

-- And they do so gladly. Highborn and lowborn alike are proud to serve─to fight and die for their country.

-- And what would you say to them? What would you tell the wives who have lost their husbands, the mothers who have lost their sons? ...That their loved ones died for naught? Over the course of a thousand years, countless men have donned these robes, and every one of them came to accept the necessity of this solution. Once, I hoped you might come to accept it as well.

-- Do not despair, my son. Soon I shall free us from the sins of antiquity... ...And bring about the change you so fervently desire.

Archbishop Thordan VII

-- If he has spoken with others, I would have their names. Escort him to a cell and question him─thoroughly.

Zephirin

-- Your Eminence.

----------------------------------

Alphinaud

-- 	You saw something, did you not? A vision of the past?

Aymeric

-- So this is the power of the Echo. Would that it had shown you a finer moment from my past. 'Twas an exercise in futility, as you saw. Faced with the firmity of his conviction, and his many ready rejoinders, my words deserted me. To be frank, I am embarrassed to recall it.

Alphinaud

-- A friend once impressed upon me the importance of differentiating between words, deeds, and beliefs. Were he here, I suspect he would judge your father's “conviction” to be no more than rank, self-serving delusion. Even so, I cannot help but wonder what manner of “change” he intends to bring about.

Aymeric

-- I have given some thought to that as well. During the battle within the Vault, the Heavens' Ward demonstrated strange and unnatural abilities.

Lucia

-- Aye, the manner in which Ser Zephirin struck down Lord Haurchefant was unlike anything I've ever seen before.

Aymeric

-- The spectacle called to mind King Thordan and his knights twelve as they are depicted in scripture─holy powers and all...

Alphinaud

-- Mere fabrications...which have become objects of faith...instilled with the belief of countless devoted souls...

-- Seven hells!

Aymeric

-- If Lady Iceheart can use her own body as a vessel for summoning, I see no reason why others could not...

Lucia

-- Are the Heavens' Ward truly so reckless?

Alphinaud

-- Unbelievable.

Aymeric

-- As they fled, my father spoke of Azys Lla. Though I know not what he intends, I fear no good shall come of it. His ambitions are too great, and his minions too powerful... We must find the Heavens' Ward, and stop my father, before it is too late.

Aymeric

-- Mistress Kali, Master Alphinaud─I, Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights of Ishgard, do hereby entreat the aid of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.

Alphinaud

-- Our aid in preventing whatever it is that the archbishop intends?

Aymeric

-- Your aid in bringing him to justice. Too much blood has been spilled for the lies he perpetuated. No more.

Me

-- Life for death. I will have Ser Zephirin's heart for what he did to Haurchefant. I shall pursue him to the end of the world if I must.

Aymeric

-- Yes...yes, of course. You two were close, I know.

-- I make no claim to know the turmoil in your soul, but I implore you, Luna--in this darkest of hours, pray lend us your strength.

-- I thank you, Luna. I have heard many men make such pledges, but you─you speak in earnest.

Alphinaud

-- Much has changed since our order's founding, but our duty to combat the primal threat has not. If the archbishop and the Heavens' Ward are guilty of the crime of summoning, then Luna and I will stop them.

Aymeric

-- Would that I could join you in the pursuit, but alas, my father's absence has thrown our government into chaos. Ever since the founding of our nation, there has been an archbishop to serve as a guiding light for the masses─a force for stability to counterbalance the High Houses' ceaseless maneuvering. Convincing the people to recognize the truth of our origins would have been difficult even with my father's support. The road ahead is that much more fraught with peril without it. Yet walk it we must, for unity is more vital to our survival than ever. After all, Nidhogg's death did not mark the cessation of Dravanian hostilities. Far from it. We will have great need of each other in the days to come.

Estinien

-- You may ever count on my lance, Ser Aymeric. To my dying breath, I shall defend Ishgard from the Horde.

Lucia

-- If I may, Lord Commander, I would like to assist the Scions in their search for the archbishop. Luna, Master Alphinaud, pray attend me outside.

Alphinaud

-- Very well. With me, Luna. I believe we have much to discuss.

-- Where could they be headed? And what does “Azys Lla” have to do with it?

Gathering himself, Alphinaud suggests you visit the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly and see if Ser Aymeric is recovered from his injuries. Accompany him to Foundation and inform the Temple Knight on duty of your desire to speak with the lord commander.

In Ser Aymeric's private chambers, the power of the Echo stirs within you once more, and you are granted a vision of the past. You watch as the lord commander accuses the church of hiding the origins of the Dragonsong War, and hear the archbishop acknowledge it to be the truth. Ser Aymeric continues, challenging his father on the morality of the church's deception, but the archbishop, steadfast in his conviction, is unswayed. Though it is a lie, Ishgard's sons and daughters must fight and die for it, for the crimes of Thordan and his knights twelve are beyond reparation. Recognizing the futility of convincing his son to accept this state of affairs, Thordan has Ser Aymeric arrested─but not before revealing that he has plans of his own to free the people of Ishgard from the sins of antiquity.

Reflecting on the unnatural powers demonstrated by the knights of the Heavens' Ward, your companions conclude that they are using their own bodies as vessels for the souls of the legendary King Thordan and his knights twelve, much as Ysayle did for Saint Shiva. Though Ser Aymeric knows not his father's plans─or the significance of “Azys Lla”─he declares that the archbishop and the Heavens' Ward must be stopped.

The lord commander duly entreats you and Alphinaud, as representatives of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, to help him bring his father to justice. In response, Alphinaud states that if the Heavens' Ward have indeed harnessed primal powers, it is the duty of the remaining Scions to oppose them. And so, with newfound purpose, Alphinaud bids you join him to discuss how you might find the archbishop.

# In Search of the Soleil

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Lucia appears to have something to say.

Lucia

-- The Soleil was eastward bound, so I sent word to Camp Cloudtop on the off chance the airship passed nearby. Sure enough, Lady Laniaitte informed me that it had been sighted by her scouts.

Alphinaud

-- Then the archbishop is somewhere in the Sea of Clouds?

Lucia

-- Or was, not long ago. The airship has not been seen since it disappeared into the northern reaches near the Blue Window. Alas, because the region is firmly held by the Vanu Vanu and not easily accessible from Camp Cloudtop, House Haillenarte has yet to establish a foothold. We will need not only an airship, but a captain bold enough to risk the beastmen's wrath.

Alphinaud

-- I think we both know the perfect candidate, Luna. Let us pay a visit to Master Garlond at the Skysteel Manufactory.

Lucia

-- I see... Then I will take my leave for now. There are other matters which require my attention.

Alphinaud

-- Who else but Master Garlond would be willing to deliver us into Vanu territory? I say we go and ask him first.

Aymeric

-- If they knew what would come of it, would they still have done it? What power could be worth such bloodshed─such sorrow...

Cid

-- Ah, the dastardly duo. What mischief have you two been getting up to lately?

Alphinaud

-- ...You haven't heard, have you? I hardly know where to start.

Cid

-- ...He was a good man.

Alphinaud

-- Cid, have you ever heard of “Azys Lla”? The archbishop spoke of it before he fled.

Cid

-- No, but it's probably some source of phenomenal cosmic power that's key to his plans.

-- From what he told Luna, the Ascians tried to tempt him as they tempted Gaius with the Ultima Weapon. Even if he spoke true about playing along, I can see him attempting to seize it.

Alphinaud

-- As if we needed another reason to pursue him...

Cid

-- Well, I'm convinced. The Enterprise is at your disposal. Come to the airship landing when you're ready to depart. Heh, it's just as well. After pulling you out of the fire these last few times, I reckoned I was due to deliver you into it.

According to Lucia, the Soleil, the archbishop's personal airship, was recently sighted in the Sea of Clouds. Unfortunately, the airship was bound for the northern reaches, which are not easily accessible from Camp Cloudtop. In order to pursue the Heavens' Ward, you and Alphinaud will need to enlist the aid of a bold airship captain─and Alphinaud knows the perfect candidate for the job.

Cid's cheery demeanor soon darkens when he learns of Lord Haurchefant's death and the archbishop's escape. Though he can offer no insight into the meaning of “Azys Lla,” he surmises that it is the source of some phenomenal cosmic power which Thordan VII covets. Recognizing the gravity of the threat, he agrees to help, and bids you join him at the airship landing when you are ready to depart.

-- Alphinaud must see to one last thing before he departs.

Alphinaud

Wedge

-- Good to see you again, Luna! It'll be a pleasure to have you aboard the Enterprise again!

Biggs

-- I, uh, heard about your man Haurchefant... Sorry for your loss, Luna.

Cid

-- The boys have been hard at work preparing for our flight, and I'm pleased to say we are ready to depart. That is, as soon as a certain... Ah.

Alphinaud

-- Pray forgive me my lateness. Tataru and I had much to discuss. We still have no news of the missing Scions, but she assures me that Urianger and Riol are pursuing promising leads.

Cid

-- Come, come─we can continue this discussion aboard the Enterprise!

Wedge

-- The others are waiting for you aboard the Enterprise, Luna! Shall we get going?

Lkhonebb

-- Hello there, madam! So you know, I'll be available to ferry you back and forth once the chief charts a course. Deputy president's orders and all that.

Alphinaud

-- From here, Camp Cloudtop looks rather far... Ahem. Be on your guard, Luna. The Vanu could be anywhere─even watching us as we speak...

Cid

-- We'll keep the Enterprise here for now, but if you need to head back to Ishgard, you can use that standard to signal for an Ironworks airship. Don't worry─we charted a route safe enough for others to fly...unless that primal shows up. But what are the odds of that, eh?

Biggs

-- The Enterprise is ready to fly at a moment's notice. Just come running if you run afoul of something you can't handle.

Wedge

-- We'll stay in touch with your Temple Knight friend, don't you worry!

Ever one to take the feelings of others into consideration, Alphinaud states that he will inform Tataru of your plans, and bids you go on ahead to the airship landing. Let Cid know that he will be along shortly.

The Enterprise has been prepared for departure, and Alphinaud has rejoined you. Inform Wedge that you are ready to board.

Aboard the Enterprise, you take a moment to yourself and gaze into the Sea of Clouds. In the silence, familiar words echo in your mind. “For those we have lost. For those we can yet save.” You close your eyes and attempt to turn your thoughts elsewhere─only to be confronted with the memory of a broken shield...

Arriving in the Blue Window, you find no Vanu waiting to receive you. Nevertheless, Alphinaud appears to be on edge.

Alphinaud advises you to be vigilant, for their scouts could be lurking anywhere─even watching you as you speak...

-- Alphinaud has a mind to start searching the Blue window.

Alphinaud

-- Assuming the Soleil is here, I doubt she will come to us. We should begin searching the isles in earnest... Of course, we must remain vigilant for Vanu scouts as well. I would rather avoid needless bloodshed.

-- Gods, look at them. So many isles...so many places to hide. No, we must not lose hope. He is out there, Luna--and we will find him.

Alphinaud

Lonu Vanu

-- Begs mercy of netherlings! Does not fight! Does not wish to die!

Alphinaud

-- Was that a Vanu being attacked? But by whom?

-- Over there! Imperial troops!?

Imperial Centurion

-- Ishgardians!? Seize them! They'll know where the archbishop is!

Alphinaud

-- The enemy of my enemy... We've no choice. With me, Luna! Protect the Vanu!

------------------------------

Imperial Centurion: Remember: Lord van Hydrus wants them alive! That's an order!
Alphinaud: Lord van Hydrus? Regula van Hydrus!?
Imperial Centurion: What are you doing!? You're a disgrace to the VIth! Subdue these savages!
Alphinaud: There's no end to them!
Unarmed Vanu Vanu: No weapons to fight netherlings! No desire to die!

------------------------------

Alphinaud

-- And so we live to fight another day...

Lonu Vanu

-- Netherlings save Lonu Vanu from certain death! Showers netherlings with thanks like summer squall! Lonu Vanu knows not what wind bears netherlings to cloud sea, but warmly welcomes them! Shows gratitude where gratitude is due!

Cid

-- Imperial troops? Here? Well, hopefully that's the last of them. We'll keep an eye out for others.

Alphinaud declares that you two should begin searching the isles in earnest for the Soleil. Follow him east and stand /lookout for the missing airship.

Though your vantage point affords an excellent view of the surrounding isles, you see nothing resembling the archbishop's airship. Proceed north and stand /lookout once more.

In the course of your search, you come upon a most unexpected sight: a unit of imperial troops surrounding a terrified Vanu Vanu. Before you can assess the situation, the troops mistake you for Ishgardians and attempt to seize you as well, apparently under the orders of “Lord van Hydrus.” With Alphinaud's help, you manage to defeat the Garleans, thus rescuing the Vanu prisoner.

Lonu Vanu, as he names himself, expresses his profound gratitude for your intervention. Though the presence of the imperials is an unfortunate development, the discovery that the Vanu here are not openly hostile to you and Alphinaud makes up for it.

-- Lonu Vanu would like very much for you to enjoy the hospitality of his village.

Lonu Vanu

-- Lonu Vanu owes much and more to netherlings. As saviors, as heroes, Zundu welcome you! To village we go! To north! Come, come!

Alphinaud

-- So the Garleans were searching for the archbishop and believed that the Vanu Vanu knew something of his whereabouts. Methods notwithstanding, they may have had the right of it... I conclude that we should accept Lonu Vanu's offer of hospitality, and visit his village.

-- I want to believe Lonu Vanu is sincere in his intentions. Nevertheless, keep your eyes open, Luna.

Lonu Vanu

-- Like breeze guides leaves to rest, come and lay down your burdens, netherlings! Lonu Vanu throws wide arms in greeting! Behold─Ok' Zundu!

Alphinaud

-- A far warmer welcome than the one you received from the Vundu, I think.

Lonu Vanu

-- Hah! Vundu bluster and blow hither and yon. Sound and fury, like aimless gale.

(Huge Sound)

Lonu Vanu

-- Eh!? What unseen lightning begets such thunderous report!?

Cid

-- There you are! Did you see it!? It's that damned flying whale again! The imperials are after it!

Alphinaud

-- Where!?

Lonu Vanu

-- The White!?

Cid

-- He's wounded!

Alphinaud

-- By the Twelve... Did the beast just eat that island!?

Lonu Vanu

-- O insatiable White, O devourer of worlds! Why must You torment us!?

-- Bah! Lonu Vanu wastes no more words on His unfathomable deeds. Come, netherlings! Come and break words with chief of Zundu!

Alphinaud

-- When you described it as a “flying feathered whale,” I naturally assumed you had taken some liberties...

Cid

-- It'll take a lot more than imperial cannons to bring that beast down...

Lonu Vanu

-- With wisdom deep as nethers and eyes clear as cloudless blue, Sonu Vanu speaks for Zundu. Hearken to his words!

-----------------------------------------------

Lonu Vanu

-- Netherlings deliver Lonu Vanu from claws of steel-shod fiends and prove nobility. He knows not to ignore zephyr winds, and brings before you with all haste.

Sonu Vanu

-- Soft rains to soothe the heart and sunshine to warm. Gratitude of Sonu, chief of Zundu, is boundless.

Alphinaud

-- We are honored to meet you, Chief Sonu. I am Alphinaud Leveilleur, and these are my companions Luna Kali and Cid Garlond. We are come in search of an airship─a flying vessel of the nethers─which we believe is somewhere in the cloud sea.

Sonu Vanu

-- Ah, like to black steel-shod contraption from which you save Lonu Vanu? Alas, no. That ship belongs to the Garlean Empire─an old enemy of ours...though not the enemy we are looking for at present.

Alphinaud

-- The men we seek wear armor of purest white, and are led by an older man in white robes.

Lonu Vanu

-- Wait! Lonu Vanu hear tell of these netherlings!

Alphinaud

-- You do? Are you certain?

Sonu Vanu

-- As sun rises and falls and returns, we are. Zundu scouts can testify to words of Lonu Vanu. 

Lonu Vanu

-- Aye, aye! Winds carry purpose of netherlings to our ears as well. Netherlings seek key to Azys Lla!

Cid

-- Now we're getting somewhere! Tell us, Chief Sonu: what exactly is this “Azys Lla”?

Sonu Vanu

-- Beware, netherlings, for blackest clouds portend greatest danger. Look not into heart of tempest. There lies ancient birthplace of sin, home of forbidden secrets. To speak more is to call the wind!

Lonu Vanu

-- But the White devours isle where key is kept. Deep within bowels of mighty Bismarck, it lies, beyond reach of the foolhardy!

Cid

-- And beyond ours...

Sonu Vanu

-- Rejoice not in His gluttony, Lonu Vanu, for as stone gives way to water and wind, all yields to the White.

Lonu Vanu

-- This he knows, Chief Sonu. Madness of Vundu bodes ill for all Vanu...

-- With every dawn, fewer and fewer remain, so great is the White's hunger...

Out of gratitude to you and Alphinaud, Lonu Vanu invites you to his village, leaving before you can make your excuses. Consult with Alphinaud and decide whether to follow or not.

Surmising that the Vanu may know the whereabouts of the archbishop and the Heavens' Ward, Alphinaud suggests you accept Lonu Vanu's offer of hospitality. Journey to the north and seek out the Vanu youth.

Shortly after you and Alphinaud arrive in the Vanu village, the sound of cannon fire reverberates throughout the Sea of Clouds, sending everyone scrambling to search for the source. When Cid subsequently arrives, he explains that the imperials have engaged Bismarck, and together you turn your eyes heavensward even as the primal's massive body casts a shadow over all. Before your disbelieving eyes, Bismarck opens wide its great maw and swallows an island whole. At this, Lonu Vanu cries out with a mixture of rage and despair, but refuses to dwell on the actions of an unfathomable god, instead urging you to speak with Sonu Vanu, chieftain of the Zundu.

Chief Sonu reveals that the archbishop and the Heavens' Ward are come to the Sea of Clouds in search of the key to Azys Lla, a land of forbidden secrets. However, their quest has been complicated by the fact that Bismarck, the insatiable white whale, has devoured the island upon which the key was kept. Though some might think the belly of a primal an ideal repository for so dangerous an artifact, Alphinaud's expression makes it abundantly clear that he is not one of them.

# Black and the White

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Alphinaud has that familiar look in his eye, which can mean only one thing ...

Alphinaud

-- So Azys Lla is home to forbidden secrets, accessible only to the bearer of a key which the archbishop covets... Much as I would like to believe it safe within the belly of Bismarck, the knights of the Heavens' Ward wield primal powers. If we do not slay the whale and claim the key first, they surely will. Quite how we will go about it is another matter. As was the case in our battle with Leviathan, we are out of our element, and this time, we have far fewer allies to call upon... Be that as it may, our customary approach still holds true. We must begin by learning more about the White. Let us each question the residents of the village, then regroup and share our findings anon.

-- ...Then the quantity of crystals needed to sustain Bismarck would exceed that consumed by Leviathan...

Cid

-- Could we not just leave the key to the forbidden land in the island-eating whale's belly? I mean, I can think of worse places to keep it. ...No? I thought not.

Sonu Vanu

-- Seek not the birthplace of sin, netherlings. They who do find only death and ruin.

Lonu Vanu

-- If netherlings seek knowledge of the White, then speak with Kunu Vali, foremost keeper of tales. But neglect not to present self with humility and respect. As sun yields to moon and moon to sun, netherlings must greet Kunu Vali with a bow. 

-- Kunu Vali holds traditions in highest regard, and so must netherlings, if they wish to hear tales of the White.

Kunu Vali

-- What ill-mannered beast comes before Kunu Vali and begs to hear tales? None who deserve aught, that much she knows!

-- Zephyr winds at your back and sunshine to warm your brow, traveler from below. Kunu Vali, keeper of tales, hears your words, and she remembers. In times long ago, in lands elsewhere, before even the cloud sea, the White is one among many. Newborn, He swims beside His many brothers, in seas of endless water. But hated, the White is, for His brothers are purest black. So great is their contempt, their loathing, that they turn upon Him and rend His flesh asunder. And so He falls, only to rise again, for merciful gods raise Him to the heavens, and there He is reborn.  The White still longs for the sea to which He cannot return. But in rebirth, a splinter of the divine is shared, and so He opens His maw, from whence come the clouds, and a new sea is born, home to Him alone. Content, He gazes below, and sees others who are as He─hated and hunted. He weeps, and in His benevolence, He raises up isles of earth and guides these people to the cloud sea. Such is the tale of His rebirth, and the salvation of the Vanu. May it never be forgot. But this demon which menaces the cloud sea...His rage is that of the Vundu, His hunger that of a wild beast. The isles are His gift to us─yet now He must consume them? Kunu Vali knows no tales like this. 

-- The Lord of the Mists is merciful and kind─not so this demon...

Cid

-- Personally, I've seen enough of that flying feathered whale already...

Alphinaud

-- So according to the Vanu Vanu, the Sea of Clouds and the floating isles were gifts from Bismarck to his people... 

Cid

-- Gifts which he has taken to eating, yes. Technically within his rights, I suppose, if perhaps a little ungenerous. Gods, eh!? But what of you, Alphinaud? Did you learn aught of value?

Alphinaud

-- Alas, no. That is, unless you have an interest in the intricacies of Vanu skyfishing...

Cid

-- Skyfishing...? My gods, that's it! Alphinaud, my boy, I could kiss you! From what we have observed, Bismarck is a creature of pure instinct, driven primarily by hunger. When wounded by the imperials, it fled─but not before devouring another island to restore its strength.

-- What I propose is this: we tow a suitably appetizing island through the Sea of Clouds, in essence “fishing” for our flying whale. Once we draw Bismarck out of hiding, we shall use dragonkillers to fire grapnels into the beast's hide, and then reel it in close, enabling our resident eikon-slayer to engage it directly.

Alphinaud

-- A bold plan, Master Garlond─but an exceedingly dangerous one. Should Luna fail to subdue the creature, she would almost certainly be eaten, along with the rest of your “appetizing island.”

Cid

-- Oh, she won't fail. And if anything does go wrong, I'll be at the helm of the Enterprise, ready to tow her out of trouble. I wouldn't entrust a task like this to anyone else.

Alphinaud

-- Nor I. I trust you have no objections to my joining you as well?

Cid

-- Not at all, the more the merrier!

-- Right, then─it seems the boys and I have a lot of work to do if the Enterprise is to be ready for our fishing trip, while you two need to find me some bait! And not just any island, mind─I want a mouthful at most!

-- The boys and I can handle most of the preparations, but we'll need you to secure us a suitable island. Let me know when it's done!

Alphinaud asserts that the Heavens' Ward, wielding primal powers, are more than capable of slaying Bismarck. Therefore, the only way to ensure that the archbishop does not obtain the key to Azys Lla is to do so first. Before confronting the Vanu Vanu's patron deity, of course, it would only be prudent to learn more of its nature. Perhaps Lonu Vanu can furnish you with the information you require.

Lonu Vanu suggests that you speak with Kunu Vali, keeper of tales. He cautions you, however, that the keeper is the traditional sort─the kind of Vanu who is not given to speaking with those who neglect to greet her with a /bow.

Heeding your request, Kunu Vali recounts the tale of Bismarck's death at the hands of his brothers and of his heavenly rebirth. The keeper further explains that Bismarck is a merciful, loving being, who guided the Vanu to the islands in the Sea of Clouds─a depiction wholly at odds with his recent behavior. Seek out Alphinaud and share your findings with him and Cid.

Inspired by a comment of Alphinaud's on the subject of skyfishing, Cid conceives a plan to slay Bismarck. By towing a small island through the Sea of Clouds, he hopes to lure the ravenous primal out of hiding, and drag the beast in close with chains fired from dragonkillers. Should the plan succeed, you would be able to engage Bismarck directly─but should it fail, you and your allies would be at the creature's mercy. For want of a better idea, Alphinaud endorses the plan. Now all you need is an island...

-- Alphinaud loves it when a plan comes together.

Alphinaud

-- Well, you heard Cid. We need an island to bait the hook. By way of a first step, I propose we speak with Chief Sonu. If the Zundu are as concerned by Bismarck's behavior as they have given us to believe, they may well be supportive of our efforts to slay him.

Sonu Vanu

-- The tramontane is upon us. The White feasts, and the Vundu rejoice in His carnage...

Alphinaud

-- Hear me, Chief Sonu. This creature which torments you now is not the deity who raised up the floating isles and made a gift of them to you. He is a perversion of your beliefs given form by the Vundu─a false savior who consumes that which he should rightly safeguard. Yet it need not be this way, Chief Sonu. We have the power to strike down this impostor...but we must beg of you an island to see it done.

Sonu Vanu

-- Motes against the tempest. In vain do they struggle... ...Yet who is Sonu to speak of what may be? Perhaps even the tramontane can turn to the ponente. Very well, netherlings. When you are ready, tell Zundu scouts what manner of island you require and they guide you to it.

Alphinaud

-- We shall not fail, Chief Sonu. On that you have my word.

-- Come, Luna--let us see how Cid's preparations are progressing.

Sonu Vanu

-- May soft rains come to cleanse us of these sins...

Wedge

-- A-Are we really going to go skyfishing for a primal!?

Cid

-- Our Ishgardian friends have furnished us with dragonkillers and ammunition, and I've taken the liberty of procuring a magitek field generator as well. Rest assured, we've chains to spare, every link forged by the manufactory's master craftsmen. If you've any lingering doubts as to their strength, know that they were originally intended to bind dragons─and were not found wanting.

Alphinaud

-- It pleases me to inform you that the Vanu Vanu have agreed to furnish us with an island of our choosing.

Cid

-- Then all that remains is to confirm the readiness of the poor buggers who'll actually be doing the fighting. Luna, let Wedge know when your party is assembled.

Alphinaud

-- My, that took hardly any time at all. The Ironworks engineers do not disappoint.

Cid

-- We'll depart for the island once you've assembled your party. Let Wedge know when you're ready.

Wedge

-- I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but I don't like this plan. I don't like it one little bit! ...But I can't help being excited all the same! So tell me, Luna: are you ready to hunt the white whale? After you, then, Luna! All aboard!

Alphinaud

-- Would that I could fight alongside you, Luna, but primal influence being what it is, I think it best that I assist Wedge with the machinery on this occasion.

Cid

-- Since we still don't know the extent of Bismarck's influence, I'd prefer to keep those not actively participating in the battle inside the ship. It would be a shame if one of us started chanting “The White! The White!” and stabbed you in the back, after all.

Inspiration often finds us in surprising ways. So it was that a casual mention of skyfishing helped Cid Garlond conceive a plan to lure out Bismarck, the Lord of the Mists, by using the Enterprise to tow an island through the Sea of Clouds. After binding the beast with chains fired from dragonkillers, he hopes you can engage it in the traditional fashion. Though the plan is somewhat sound in theory, there is no telling how effective it will be in practice. Nevertheless, the engineer has seen you through many dangerous situations in the past, so at least the odds are in his favor...

Alphinaud

-- Forgive me, Luna. Had I known what was happening, mayhap I could have done something to stop them... Alas, Wedge and I were still sealed within the engine room and heard naught of the struggle until it was over. And now, for all our efforts, the archbishop holds the very thing we sought to keep from him...But all is not lost, for we yet live, and we know their destination! Let us give chase and bring an end to their machinations!

-- As you'd expect, they flew off in the direction that beam was pointing. Bastards...

Alphinaud suggests that you seek the support of the Zundu in slaying Bismarck and petition Chief Sonu for an island to bait the Enterprise's hook. Present your proposal to the chieftain and see what he says.

Swayed by Alphinaud's impassioned denunciation of Bismarck as a false savior, Chief Sonu declares that you will have your island. Inform Cid that you have fulfilled your part of the bargain.

Cid's preparations have proceeded smoothly, and the required chains and ballistas have already been delivered to the Sea of Clouds. You need but notify Wedge when you have assembled your party of brave companions, and you will be ferried to the island provided by the Zundu.

You inform Wedge that you are ready to hunt the white whale. Board the Enterprise with your companions and rid the Sea of Clouds of Bismarck's ravenous presence.

You execute Cid's bold plan to perfection, and the Lord of Mists falls like so many before him. Soon after, the long-silent voice of Hydaelyn resounds in your mind once more, though you must strain to make out Her words. Alas, it fades as quickly as it came, and you are left to wonder at Her intent...

Prize in hand, you turn towards the Enterprise, only to find Igeyorhm and Archbishop Thordan barring your path. After wresting the key from your grasp, the Ascian observes that you have regained the blessing of Light─albeit at a fraction of its former strength. Retrieving the key, the archbishop casts it heavensward, and the Allagan relic emits a beam of light pointing the way to Azys Lla. The pair then depart aboard the Soleil as you, still weak from your struggles against Bismarck and Igeyorhm, can only watch, powerless to stop them.

After you disembark from the Enterprise, thoroughly downcast, Alphinaud assures you that all is not lost. Though the archbishop has claimed the key to Azys Lla, you yet live to give chase. Scant consolation, perhaps...but true nonetheless. Having all but placed the prize in your enemy's hand, you are fortunate to have a chance at redemption. It is time to put away self-pity, and steel yourself for the task ahead.
