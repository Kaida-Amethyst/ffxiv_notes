-- Adversity acquaints a man with strange bedfellows, as Alphinaud knows only too well.

Alphinaud

-- But how are we to carry out this bold endeavor? Even with an army of knights at our backs, a direct assault on the Vault seems unlikely to succeed.

Lucia

-- You are correct, Master Alphinaud. Not even the assembled might of House Fortemps and the Temple Knights would be sufficient. With the support of another party, however, we may yet stand a chance.

Alphinaud

-- You speak of one of the other High Houses?

Lucia

-- Precisely the opposite. I speak of the revolutionaries rumored to reside in the Brume. 'Twas these disgruntled Ishgardians who opened the gates of our city to the heretics, I believe.

Alphinaud

-- But of course! If their hatred of the Holy See drove them to such deeds, they might well be persuaded to assist in Ser Aymeric's rescue, knowing the truth he would lay bare...

Lucia

-- Such is my hope, Master Alphinaud. And I would have you and Luna reach out to them. As a Temple Knight and sworn servant of the Holy See, any overtures I make are doomed to fail. But as outsiders, the two of you may receive a warmer welcome.

Alphinaud

-- Very well. We shall seek out the leader of these revolutionaries, and make our case.

Lucia

-- My thanks. Estinien--will your brothers heed your command if you order them to stand aside?

Estinien

-- The dragoons have no love for politics, my lady. They will gladly watch and wait while the highborn fight amongst themselves.

Alphinaud

-- How very wise. Luna--we should hurry to the Forgotten Knight. Tataru may have knowledge of the revolutionaries.

Haurchefant

-- So she hopes to find a friend in the enemy of our enemy... Well, well, well...

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- Tread warily, Mistress Kali. Then men and woman you seek may misinterpret your intentions.

Tataru

-- Luna, Alphinaud! Gods, I've been worried sick! It's so good to see you!

Alphinaud

-- And you, Tataru. How did you manage to escape the chaos in the streets?

Tataru

-- Gibrillont and the others barricaded the doors until the heretics left. No one was harmed, thankfully. But what about you two? What came of your journey?

Alphinaud

-- It would seem that the Forgotten Knight was spared the worst of the earlier chaos...

Tataru

-- ...You're not serious. What was Ser Aymeric thinking!? I mean, the way you two talk about him, I wouldn't have believed... Anyway, I've heard rumors of the people you're looking for, but I doubt they'll be of much use. The only thing I can say with any certainty is that they're led by someone called “the Mongrel.”

Alphinaud

-- A queer moniker if ever I have heard one─but mayhap it will make the individual in question easier to find. Come, let us all make inquiries below.

-- If truth be told, I doubt anyone will be willing to speak of this “Mongrel.” But we may still be able to confirm that Tataru's information is correct.

Tataru

-- At first, the people here were a bit standoffish, but with a little effort─and a lot of parley─I've managed to make plenty of friends!

Brume Elder

-- Are you whispering? I swear, I can't hear a word you're saying.

Brume Rat

-- I don't know a godsdamned thing about the Mongrel, but if I did, you can be sure I wouldn't tell you!

-- Piss off back where you came from, outlander. You'll get nothing from me!

Brume Starveling

-- A mongrel? Not sure I catch your meaning. To a blue blood, we're all of us dogs down here.

-- Look around you, milady. Mongrels as far as the eye can see.

Alphinaud

-- Not a single shred of information? Just as I expected. These revolutionaries would not have evaded capture for so long without the masses' complicity. Still, it is good to know that Tataru's ears are as sharp as ever.

Even with an army of knights, a direct assault on the Vault would be fruitless. However, were you to enlist the aid of the revolutionaries hiding in the Brume, Lucia believes you may yet have a chance of success. Together with Alphinaud, go and speak with Tataru at the Forgotten Knight and see what she knows of the revolutionaries and their leader.

Tataru knows little and less of the gang you seek, save for the moniker of their leader: the Mongrel. For lack of a better option, Alphinaud bids you take to the streets and question the residents of the Brume.

As expected, the people are not wont to speak of the revolutionaries in their midst. Inform Alphinaud of your failure.

Alphinaud seems wholly unconcerned by your lack of success. And little wonder: one cannot simply ask where a gang of notorious outlaws is hiding and expect to receive an honest answer. By way of consolation, your fruitless efforts have lent credence to Alphinaud's theory that the revolutionaries are being sheltered by the populace...

# The Spice of Life

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Alphinaud is not one to be easily deterred.

Alphinaud

-- Frustrating though it may be, we must press on. While I continue speaking with the people of the Brume, why not go and see if Gibrillont knows aught of value? As the proprietor of the Forgotten Knight, surely he must have heard whispers of the Mongrel before. We can only hope that he will be more forthcoming than the others.

Tataru

-- If you haven't yet, you should learn the Manderville art of parley. It's surprisingly effective─so long as you stick to topics you know well. For example, the other day I was discussing the copper ore market with this one gentleman...

Gibrillont

-- You know, people long for a sympathetic ear, but they need to know that it comes with tight lips. Discretion, Luna--that's what my customers expect. If they don't get it, then I don't get them. That being said, I'm not without my sympathies. I've heard the tales, and I know you've done right by highborn and lowborn alike. Least I can do is point you in the right direction. But to do that, I'll need you to do something for me. So happens there's a hunter up in the Crozier who owes me a fair bit of coin. However, I've agreed to accept payment in fresh herbs. Go and get them for me. Agreed?

-- Tell the hunter I sent you, and he should hand over the herbs without a fuss. Come back here as soon as you have them. Simple as that.

Hulking Hunter

-- So you're Gibrillont's errand girl? Good, good! How's he doing? Same as always? Right, right... Anyroad, I hope he appreciates how much trouble I had to go through on account of his bloody herbs. Tell him to enjoy them while they last, because I doubt I'll be able to find any more next year.

Gibrillont

--  Well? You going to hand them over or not? Aye, this ought to do it. With a few other spices, I can make it just like she used to... There are few things which stir the hearts of men like a sip of mulled wine. Share a glass with the right people, and who knows what stories they'll share?

Displaying an uncharacteristic lack of imagination, Alphinaud decides to continue questioning the people of the Brume, and bids you speak with Gibrillont in the meantime. Perhaps the proprietor of the Forgotten Knight will be more forthcoming than his customers.

In response to your inquiries about the Mongrel, Gibrillont stresses that discretion is key to running a successful tavern, making it all too clear that he will divulge no useful information. Before you can turn to leave, however, he offers to point you in the right direction in exchange for a small favor. Make your way to the Jeweled Crozier and collect a satchel of herbs from a hunter in Gibrillont's stead.

The hunter hands over the herbs with minimal fuss. Return to the Forgotten Knight and deliver them to Gibrillont.

Herbs in hand, the proprietor of the Forgotten Knight sets about preparing a batch of mulled wine. Few things stir the hearts of men so well, he says. If shared with the right people, what stories─and secrets─might spill from their lips?

# Noble Indiscretions

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Gibrillont has a faraway look in his eyes.

Gibrillont

-- Now that I think on it, there's a woman I know who's rather fond of this blend. Hierytha is her name, and she resides in the Pillars. She's a maidservant to some noble house or another, I forget. Anyway, be a shame if she didn't get to try this wine. Why not give her a bottle?

-- Wonder what it's like being waited on by scores and scores of servants... After a time, the faces must start to blur together. But the servants, they remember. How can they not?

Hierytha

-- Y-Yes, I am Hierytha. Beg your pardon, but do I know you, miss.

-- I...I know this smell! This is the wine that girl used to prepare! Her special recipe! It must be decades since I last tasted this. Oh, the poor dear... Such a shame that she was taken in by that baron. He cut a dashing figure, I'll grant you that. Tall, slender, long of ear... <sigh> But those dazzling ruby eyes of his were filled with lust. 'Twas naught more than infatuation, what she felt, but she convinced herself it was love...and he couldn't help but take advantage. But when her belly started to grow, gods, the scandal! I mean, 'tis not an uncommon occurrence, but that it was with a Hyur made it so much, well...I needn't tell you. She was discharged from his service─cast out onto the streets, like so much refuse. After she returned to the Brume, we drifted apart. I only learned of her death years later by chance... Gods, it feels like a lifetime ago...

Gibrillont

-- So the amorous nobleman beds his maidservant, then casts her aside when the seed takes root. Not the most original tale, is it? Cold comfort for the women and children who live it, though.

```plaintext
Gibrillont recalls a maidservant named Hierytha who is rather fond of this particular recipe for twice-mulled wine. Reasoning that it would be a shame for her to miss out, he bids you bring a bottle to her in the Pillars as a gift.

Hierytha recognizes the blend of herbs and spices to be the same as one used by a young Hyuran girl decades ago. Reminiscing, she speaks of how the girl fell in love with the nobleman she served─an Elezen baron with striking red eyes. Alas, the baron took advantage of the girl's affections, and cast her out onto the streets when she became pregnant with his child. She passed away sometime later, after returning to the Brume and giving birth, but Hierytha only learned of it years after the fact. Leave the maidservant to her memories and return to the Forgotten Knight.

Such incidents between a nobleman and a maidservant are not rare occurrences, Gibrillont observes. Yet the banality of the tale makes it no less tragic...

System Guide

-- Gibrillont's face is a mask, but beneath it you sense something old and bitter.

Gibrillont

-- Even the penitent can appreciate wine from time to time. Take Gerraldieux, for example. Surely you've heard of him. No? He's a monk who offers succor to the poorest of the poor in the Brume. A man of many vows, but none which prohibit spirituous beverages. Aye, if ever there was a man who deserved a drink, it'd be him.

-- There's no shortage of suffering in this world, is there? Yet all too often, men of means are happy to turn a blind eye. “Why should I care? It's not my story,” they say. But they're wrong. They're a part of it, same as we all are.

Gerraldieux

-- Halone's blessings be upon you, miss. I─ A gift? For me?

-- This scent...how reminiscent of a wine once made by a dear old friend, may her soul rest in peace...

-- Forsaken by her family, she toiled tirelessly to feed and clothe her child. Yet somehow she found time to help me tend to those in even worse circumstances, so compassionate she was, so full of love for her fellow man. 'Twas that love which gave her child strength to endure the scorn of the other younglings... <sigh> That little girl, bless her heart, she couldn't help what she was. Eventually, she won them over, but those first few years were trying─even more so when she had to start fending for herself. I remember days she spent standing on the walls─raven black hair flowing in the wind, staring out, as if searching for her mother's face in the mists...

-- I shall raise a glass to their memories tonight.

Gibrillont

-- ...She was a remarkable woman, Luna. After everything she was forced to endure, she still remained hopeful for the future. For her daughter's future...

Even a penitent can appreciate fine wine, and so Gibrillont would have you deliver a bottle to Gerraldieux, who tends to the poorest of the poor in the Brume. Head below and present Gibrillont's gift to the monk.

The scent of the twice-mulled wine is enough to bring Gerraldieux's memories of the young mother to the fore, and words unbidden begin to spill from his lips. So filled with love and compassion for her fellow man was she that, despite toiling tirelessly to feed and clothe her daughter, she took time to help Gerraldieux administer succor to the poor. Her loss was keenly felt, most of all by the child she left behind, whom even now the monk can recall passing days atop the walls, her raven black hair flowing in the wind as she stared out into the mists in silence. Leave the monk to his memories and return to the Forgotten Knight.

“She was a remarkable woman,” Gibrillont says after a time, and when you look into his eyes, you know he speaks the truth. For after all she was forced to endure, she still held fast to hope─if not for herself, then for her beloved daughter.

Gibrillont

-- Some bonds are thicker than blood...but blood still defines us─and divides us in the end. It's the legacy of our parents, Luna, and we can't escape it, no matter how hard we try. So the Mongrel and her pups chose to embrace theirs─to proclaim it to all and sundry. If you can understand that, then maybe you can find her on your own.

Brume Starveling

-- Still looking for your mongrel? Like I said before, take your pick. Plenty around, if you know where to look. Or did you fancy someone specific?

Me

-- I'm looking for a mongrel with ruby red eyes and raven black hair.

Brume Starveling

-- Ho, someone's got unusual tastes. Afraid I can't help you, though. Won't, rather. It's bloody obvious you ain't of the Brume. Did you think I'd just tell you 'cause you asked nicely?

----------(In other possible)

Me

Brume Starveling

-- What, coeurl got your tongue? Off you trot, then.

Me

Alphinaud

-- Have you made any progress, Luna.

We cannot escape the legacy left to us by our parents. The Mongrel and her pups have chosen to embrace that inescapable truth...but how can that information lead you to her?

Having discerned the purpose of Gibrillont's errands, you surmise that the Mongrel is none other than the raven-haired, ruby-eyed child born of the Elezen nobleman and the Hyuran woman. The reaction of the peasant you press for information serves to confirm your suspicions. Share your discovery with Alphinaud in the Forgotten Knight.

Though the whereabouts of the Mongrel are still unknown to you, Alphinaud feels confident that your newfound knowledge of her features will help greatly in your search.

-- Th-They didn't much care for my story about the weathered cane...

Alphinaud

-- For once, it would seem the fates are smiling upon us. Had those ruffians forced our hand, I dare not think what would have ensued.

Beggarly Fellow

-- Whatever it is you've got to say, say it!

Filthy Fellow

Hilda

-- Before you start─let's go somewhere a bit more private, eh? The Forgotten Knight, say.

Alphinaud

-- I think it best if you take the lead this time, Luna.

Tataru

-- If you're nervous, I could try parleying with them on our behalf. Perhaps they'd be interested in techniques for working lauan logs...or maybe the tale of the cursed gladius? Oh, I know─the legendary skillet! Everyone loves that one!

Hilda

-- ...So while you were on your way to kill Nidhogg, you stumbled on some dirty secrets that the Holy See has been hidin' for centuries.

Beggarly Fellow

-- Eh? What are they on about?

Hilda

-- The High Houses, and what makes a nobleman so bleedin' noble. They trace their blood back to King Thordan and his knights twelve─the founders of Ishgard. But our friends here reckon we're all descended from the heroes of eld─highborn and lowborn alike. And so Ser Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights, has gone to ask the archbishop if he wouldn't mind lettin' everyone know.

Filthy Fellow

-- Is he simple!? The old bastard'll have him executed for heresy!

Hilda

-- Well, seems to me that's what the good ser wants. Seems he thinks a noble sacrifice will serve to prove his claims.

Alphinaud

-- We cannot stand idly by and allow Ser Aymeric to do this. Ishgard has need of him.

Hilda

-- Look, you've a good heart. I can see that. Willin' to risk your neck for someone else, even when his troubles ain't yours. But what's this got to do with me?

Alphinaud

-- If Ser Aymeric is imprisoned in the Vault, we will need all the help we can muster to breach their defenses and rescue him.

(Before Hilda providing more question, a huge sound outbreak, and interrupted the talk)

Hilda

-- What in the hells─!?

Charibert

-- <sniff> Ahhh, the unmistakable scent of heresy... And what do we have here? The honored guests of House Fortemps consorting with the queen of rats? Oooh. Plotting insurrection I shouldn't wonder! Tsk-tsk. That won't do. Sickness is wont to fester and spread. It must be burned out ere the infection takes hold.

Hilda

-- I reckon ser'd be happy to wield the irons himself. Well, so happens I've got irons of my own.

Charibert

-- Ahahaha! Such simple creatures, rats. Certain to attack when cornered. Let us step outside, milady. In here, your toys could hurt someone.

Lucia

-- I thought the Heavens' Ward might come here as well.

Haurchefant

-- They came to the Temple Knights' headquarters?

Lucia

-- Aye. Ser Grinnaux announced that the lord commander had been imprisoned under suspicion of heresy, and that the Heavens' Ward had been granted full authority in his stead. 

Haurchefant

-- Then the Heavens' Ward now commands the Temple Knights... 

Lucia

-- Those still loyal to Ser Aymeric answer to me. Alas, that amounts to but half our number. The other half, who opposed his promotion to lord commander, have gathered at the Vault as ordered.

Hilda

-- Bolsterin' the guard already, eh? If I didn't know any better, I'd say you're expected.

Lucia

-- I take it you're in charge around here?

Hilda

Lucia

-- I never liked him, not since his days as an inquisitor. He took far too much pleasure in his work.

Haurchefant

-- Time is of the essence, Luna. We must move quickly, before they discern our intent!

Beggarly Fellow

Filthy Fellow

Hilda

-- Let me guess: you're wondering why I chose “the Mongrel,” right? Because it's what I am, and I'm not ashamed of it. Not anymore. Besides, even my pureblood pups have more in common with me than the lords and ladies up on high. They none of 'em are well bred. Hells, some of their mothers were cast out after a spot of fun, same as mine.

-- Story old as time─and one we're sick of hearing, which is why we took up arms. Not that we mean to hold all the blue bloods to account. Some have done right by us, I'll allow, like them in House Haillenarte. Not that we mean to hold all the blue bloods to account.

```plaintext
In the midst of considering your next course of action, Alphinaud suddenly realizes that Tataru is nowhere to be seen. Fearing that she may have run afoul of the revolutionaries, he rushes towards the doors leading to the Brume, motioning for you to follow.

You cast about for Tataru, but find no sign of her. Head to another vantage point and continue your search.

You spot Tataru being pursued by two men, and immediately give chase. Soon after, the strangers corner the trembling girl and seem set to do something unspeakable when Alphinaud accosts them from afar. His attempts to defuse the situation only serve to rile the men further, however, and violence appears inevitable─until a raven-haired woman with ruby eyes appears, and commands Tataru's tormentors to desist. It would seem her name is Hilda. In the taut silence which follows, she regards you with interest, waiting for you to state your reason for coming.

Before you can speak, Hilda suggests you accompany her to the Forgotten Knight, where you may discuss matters in private. Follow her to the tavern up above and continue your conversation there.

At Hilda's request, Gibrillont orders his staff to clear the Forgotten Knight and grant you privacy, after which you explain your reasons for coming in full. As Alphinaud attempts to win the revolutionaries' cooperation─seemingly in vain─Ser Charibert, a knight of the Heavens' Ward, strides into the tavern, accusing you and the others of plotting insurrection. With no other options left to you, you accept his offer to step outside and face him in battle.

Joined by Lord Haurchefant and Lucia, you manage to overwhelm Ser Charibert, who withdraws. The joy of victory swiftly dissipates, however, when you learn that Ser Aymeric has been imprisoned, and the Heavens' Ward placed in command of the Temple Knights. Recognizing that the situation has come to a head, Hilda agrees to assist with the rescue mission.

Recognizing your curiosity, Hilda explains that she took to calling herself “the Mongrel” out of a newfound pride for her mixed heritage, in spite of the discrimination she and others like her suffer. In the end, she declares, her followers have come to believe that the differences between lowborn and highborn are far greater than those between pureblood and mongrel. Thus united in purpose and pledged to Ser Aymeric's cause, they hope to bring about long overdue and lasting change.

# A Knight's Calling🎧😭

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Now that all the players are assembled, Hilda is eager to get on with it.

Hilda

-- We've been working in secret to undermine the Holy See and the High Houses. That much I'll acknowledge. But this nonsense about us throwing wide the gates for the heretics is just that: nonsense.

Lucia

-- If not you, then who?

Hilda

-- You Temple Knights, of course. Reckoned it was your beloved Ser Aymeric's doing at first, but then I heard how he lost his head. My next best guess would be the Heavens' Ward. That way they'd have the perfect excuse to go door-to-door through the Brume. Slaughter the heretics and their “sympathizers” in one fell swoop.

Haurchefant

-- But the Heavens' Ward's scheme did not account for Lady Iceheart's intervention...and so they have been forced to improvise.

Hilda

-- A fine bloody mess, ain't it? But the die is cast. So what's the plan?

Lucia

-- We must divert the attention of the High Houses away from the city, and to do that, we need the cooperation of your allies in their service.

Hilda

-- ...And what makes you think I have friends in high places?

Lucia

-- You would be fools not to, given your goals. Lowborn knights are ideal recruits. Most swore fealty only out of desire for a better life. If offered an opportunity to shed the yoke and live for themselves, who among them would not at least be tempted to take it? Rare is the man eager to die for a cause he does not hold dear. But it need not come to that this day. If they and their fellow knights are deployed afield to deal with a new threat─a massing of heretics, for example─then they will be unable to join in the defense of the Vault.

Hilda

-- Huh. Spread false reports of an attack to get 'em out of harm's way, you mean?

Alphinaud

-- The city will not soon forget the heretics' last assault. If the High Houses believe another attack is imminent, they will have no choice but to act.

Lucia

-- Can it be done?

Hilda

-- Can we trick them into leaving Ishgard? Aye. Can we keep them out for long? Not bloody likely. Make sure you're ready before I send word, because you won't get a second chance at this.

Alphinaud

-- Then it is decided. To the Vault! The archbishop must be held to account!

Lucia

-- And the lord commander granted his liberty!

Hilda

-- One chance only, Luna. Make it count.

Beggarly Fellow

-- So, er...what happens if we win?

Filthy Fellow

-- You seriously mean to attack the Vault, then, do you? As in, charge in there screaming and swinging steel? Bloody hells...

Alphinaud

-- Gods help me, I think we just might do this...

Tataru

-- Did you see the way she wielded that weapon of hers? Maybe I should get one for my own protection...

Haurchefant

-- With allies such as these, we cannot fail!

Lucia

-- Hearken to me, everyone! We have two objectives: rescue Ser Aymeric and apprehend the archbishop. We will therefore divide our forces into two parties. Estinien and I will make ready to breach the underground gaol and search for the lord commander. We will not move, however, until the second party has entered the Vault. I speak of your party, Warrior of Light, together with Lord Haurchefant and Master Alphinaud. For this plan to succeed, you will need to fight your way into the highest levels of the Vault, even unto the archbishop's private chambers. When the Heavens' Ward realize what you intend, they will fly to their master's side, leaving only a token force to guard the gaol. Temple Knights loyal to our cause have already secured the entrance to the Vault. Once you are within, they will signal to us. If all goes to plan, we shall rejoin you with Ser Aymeric and confront the archbishop together. Is everyone clear as to their duties? Then let us do what must needs be done!

Tataru

-- I wish I still had some blood pearls...

Alphinaud

-- 'Twould seem we must again come to blows with the Heavens' Ward. We emerged from trial by combat relatively unscathed, but... I pray we are a match for the whole of their order.

Haurchefant

-- I would be lying if I said the idea of drawing my blade in the Vault does not give me pause...

-- But a knight lives to serve, and there is no greater calling for a knight than to save the life of his fellow man. If I must brandish sword and shield in those hallowed halls to do so, then so be it.

Temple Knight Squire

-- The others are in position, Mistress Luna. I will send word once you and your party have entered...

-- Godsspeed, madam. For Ser Aymeric, and for Ishgard.

The Vault (Description)

Ser Aymeric's attempt to bring the truth of the Dragonsong War to light has ended in failure. Imprisoned by the archbishop under suspicion of heresy, he now languishes in the gaol underneath the Vault. Yet all is not yet lost, for Lucia has hatched a bold plan to see justice done. While her party frees Ser Aymeric from captivity, you are to lead a party into the highest levels of the Vault and seize Thordan VII. Though the knights of the Heavens' Ward will attempt to bar your passage, you must press on, for the future of Ishgard hangs in the balance!

Lucia's plan to rescue Ser Aymeric hinges upon luring the bulk of Ishgard's defenders out of the city. Correctly deducing that the revolutionaries have recruited knights in service to the High Houses, she asks Hilda to help by ordering these sympathizers to spread word of a heretic army massing outside the Gates of Judgement. Hilda agrees, but not before cautioning her that the deception will not last long. Ask Lucia what role she has in mind for you.

Although the forces of the High Houses should no longer be a factor, a contingent of Temple Knights and the Heavens' Ward will doubtless remain to guard the archbishop and the imprisoned Ser Aymeric. Therefore, Lucia intends to divide her forces into two parties: yours to pursue Thordan VII and draw the attention of the Heavens' Ward, and hers to rescue Ser Aymeric during the ensuing chaos. Temple Knights still loyal to the lord commander have secured the entrance to the Vault. Speak with the squire outside to confirm that the others are in position.

Once you and your companions make your entrance, the Temple Knight squire will send word to Lucia and the others, who stand ready to breach the underground gaol. See to your remaining preparations and commence the assault.

After facing wave after wave of Temple Knights and the Heavens' Ward besides, you stand at the pinnacle of the Vault, unbowed. Unable to repel your advance, Ser Zephirin gives the order to retreat, and Ser Charibert reluctantly obeys. Frantically, you give chase, sensing that your chance to seize the archbishop is slipping away.

Rejoined by your companions and a wounded Ser Aymeric, you pursue Thordan VII, finally catching up with him as he prepares to board an airship and escape. After exchanging glances, you and Lord Haurchefant rush headlong towards the vessel─but in your haste to apprehend your quarry, you fail to notice a transformed Ser Zephirin taking aim at you, a spear of pure light in his hand. Alert to the danger, Lord Haurchefant bellows a warning and raises his shield in your defense, but the steel gives way, and the spear finds a mark...

The airship forgotten, you and the others surround Lord Haurchefant, who lies upon the ground struggling to breathe. As Ser Aymeric cradles him in his arms, the fallen knight looks to you with a mixture of agony and relief, and bids you favor him with a smile...before the light leaves his eyes forever.

Outside the Vault, the Temple Knight squire informs you that the others have gone on ahead to Fortemps Manor. Join them and together inform Count Edmont of his son's fate.

To serve; to protect; to sacrifice. There is no greater calling for a knight...or so Count Edmont labors to convince himself. Nothing you can say will be of comfort to him now. Go, and leave the count to mourn in private.

Alphinaud has ever prided himself on his words, but when faced with a grieving father, he could find none. As he reflects on the many ways in which Lord Haurchefant helped you in the past, he grows quiet once more, and turns to look away...
