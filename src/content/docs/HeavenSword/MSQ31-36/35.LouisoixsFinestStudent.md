-- It is plain that recent events have shaken Alphinaud to the core.

Alphinaud

-- ...Once again, I find myself at a loss for words. But Thancred is right. We must return to the Rising Stones and apprise our companions of...all of this. Pray make your way there at once. I will send word to Y'shtola and the others of our imminent return.

-- Let us return to the Rising Stones. We must gather our companions...

Tataru

-- Why does everyone look so grim? Has something happened? Say something, for heavens' sake!

Alisaie

-- ...'Twould seem you bring ill tidings, Brother.

Alphinaud

-- ...Aye. Behind the Griffin's mask, we found the grinning face of an old adversary... Ilberd. I know not how, but he had in his possession the eyes of Nidhogg, whose dread power he used to initiate a summoning ritual, even as we looked on...

Y'shtola

-- By the Twelve...

Alisaie

-- I don't understand. To attempt such a magick requires every onze of one's aether. No one─not even Grandfather─could cast it and hope to survive...

Alphinaud

-- Indeed. It was ever a last resort─as I am certain Papalymo was aware.

Urianger

-- Thus did the pupil follow in the footsteps of his master...even unto the grave.

Alphinaud

-- I have as yet been unable to explain how Ilberd came to possess Nidhogg's eyes. In the depths of the Sea of Clouds, a perpetual storm of water- and wind-aspected aether rages. No mortal could endure such conditions.

Y'shtola

-- Then mayhap it was the work of an Ascian. But now is not the time for idle speculation. Krile, I have need of your assistance.

Krile

-- I─ Yes. Yes, of course.

Y'shtola

-- We must inspect the cocoon of light, and ascertain the state of the primal trapped within. Between our respective talents, I daresay we shall glean some measure of insight.

Krile

-- Understood. I can't promise I'll be able to sense much through the barrier, but I shall certainly do my best.

Y'shtola

-- As shall I. Let us be about it, then.

Alisaie

-- ...What, without so much as a “by your leave”!?

Urianger

-- Pray forgive Archon Y'shtola her brevity. She seeketh employment, lest her grief deprive her of the will to act. A desire to comfort Yda doubtless compoundeth her unseemly haste. I, too, must contend with this grievous loss in mine own way. By thy leave, Lady Alisaie, I shall honor our fallen colleague through gainful study. There exist writings which may yet further our understanding of this cocoon of light...

Alisaie

-- ...Mayhap I was too quick to judge. Surrendering to sadness and regret would be a poor tribute to Papalymo's sacrifice.

Alphinaud

-- Quite. We must begin preparations to face Ilberd's accursed creation without delay. What time we have was purchased at too dear a price for us to squander it.

---------------------------------

Tataru

-- All I want to do is weep, but right now we need to hold back the tears and do what must be done...

Alisaie

-- The containment spell appears stable for now, but it is by no means a permanent solution. We must hold ourselves ready that we might act at a moment's notice.

Alphinaud

-- My own grief is as a crushing weight upon my heart, and when I think of what Yda must be feeling... Papalymo's sacrifice cannot be in vain. We will find the means to deal with this primal.

Though he has scarcely begun to come to terms with what came to pass at Baelsar's Wall, Alphinaud resolves to gather the Scions and make a full report. Head back to the Rising Stones, and announce your return to Alisaie.

After relating the events that took place in Ala Mhigo, Alphinaud finally breaks the news of Papalymo's passing. Coming so soon after the loss of Minfilia, the Archon's death seems even harder to bear, but all present resolve to honor his sacrifice through decisive action. For though the fallen thaumaturge's spell has granted the realm some precious respite, the primal summoned by Ilberd will not be contained forever...

# The Obvious Solution🎧

System Guide

-- The interminable wait for news from Gridania seems to be taking its toll on Alisaie.

Alisaie

-- Ah, Luna. I wish I had more to tell you, but the situation in the East Shroud remains largely unchanged. ...Meaning we still have no idea how long it will be before─

-- A communication from the Alliance! One moment.

-- ...Yes, of course. Our representatives will be present. My thanks.

-- Word from Gridania: the council will shortly be reconvened. The Alliance leaders have already begun to assemble.

Alphinaud

-- They wish to discuss the primal, of course. As of Y'shtola's last report, the cocoon yet hung above the Wall, unchanged...

Alisaie

-- Yes. But the Elder Seedseer doubtless shares our concerns about how long it will remain so. I am told that Cid Garlond has been called in to add his expertise to proceedings.

Alphinaud

-- A wise decision. The more minds we have working on this, the better.

Alisaie

-- Well then, I suggest we leave the Rising Stones in Tataru's capable hands and make haste for the Lotus Stand.

Tataru

-- Let's see here... Riol's report needs to be filed, Alianne has requested additional supplies, and then there's─ Oh! Don't mind me! Everything's under control!

Silent Conjurer

-- Welcome, Warrior of Light. This way, if you please.

Towering Tarveler

-- A word if you would, good sir. This place, it is within the realm of Eorzea?

Vesper Bay Resident

-- You're an odd-looking fellow, aren't you? Still...takes all sorts, I s'pose. This here's Vesper Bay─“Thanalan's door to the ocean,” as some folk like to call it...

Towering Tarveler

-- Am I to understand from your answer that I have indeed arrived in Eorzea?

Vesper Bay Resident

-- Eh? ...Yes. You're in Eorzea.

Towering Tarveler

-- Ah, a plain response at last! And the one I wanted, at that! My journey was not without its hardships, and I would sooner travel by land than put to sea again!

-- You do not believe that so small a bark could bear me across the ocean? Such timid little sailors! I had but to set my course, then set my jaw till I made port!

-- Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah!

-- Though...'twould perhaps have been wise to lay down my oars a moment to sup on more than the spray of brinewater. By the trembling of my limbs, I sense a brief repast may be in order...

-- Nay! I will not hearken to the feeble grumblings of an empty belly! Duty comes before all!

Kan-E-Senna

-- Dear friends...pray accept my heartfelt thanks for your efforts in defense of Gridania's borders. I would fain dwell longer on my gratitude for the support of the Alliance, but the situation at Baelsar's Wall demands that we forgo such pleasantries.

Keeper of the Entwined Serpents

-- According to our most recent intelligence, the cocoon of light that formed in the air above the Wall remains undimmed and unbroken. After measuring the cocoon's aetheric concentrations, Archon Y'shtola has confirmed the presence of a primal entity...

Raubahn

-- Hmph. So we must assume that Ilberd's thrice-damned god is indeed trapped within. And what news of the imperials? They are not like to ignore such a spectacle.

Keeper of the Entwined Serpents

-- Sir. A Garlean airship was observed making an approach, but the vessel was destroyed when it drew near. The Empire appears to have made no subsequent attempts to reach the object.

Kan-E-Senna

-- The soldiers who witnessed the incident spoke of a “lance of light” issuing from within the cocoon. Of an entire warship being reduced to smoking ruin in the space of a moment...  Veterans of Carteneau, meanwhile...likened the destruction to that wrought by the fiery wrath of Bahamut.

Alisaie

-- We could face another Calamity...

Alphinaud

-- So the primal is awake, then? Contained, yes, but for how long? We must destroy it now, lest it break free!

Cid

-- Agreed. There is, however, the small matter of how to get close enough to a being that swats warships from the sky as you would a bothersome gnat...

Nero

-- Is this truly so complex a puzzle? Or have you no stomach for the obvious solution?

Cid

-- What in the hells are you doing here!?

Nero

-- A pleasure to see you too, Garlond. Now, if you would be so kind as to explain to these good people why you should be begging me for my assistance, that would be most appreciated.

Aymeric

-- Who is this man?

Nero

-- Oh, how terrifically rude of me! Nero tol Scaeva, former tribunus of the XIVth Legion of the Garlean Empire. These days, however, one might say that I am something of a free agent.

Cid

-- What do you want, Nero?

Nero

-- I was getting to that. Although you already know what I am about to propose, old friend.

-- As you have rather belatedly realized, within that frail binding lurks an entity alike in strength to the great Bahamut. And the only force in existence which might conceivably contend with such a foe is the very creation which captured the elder primal in the first place. I speak, of course, of Omega.

Raubahn

-- Omega!? That hulk has been gathering dust beneath the plains of Carteneau since the Allagans breathed their last! And none alive knows how to wake it.

Nero

-- I'm sorry─do you understand who it is with whom you have the privilege of speaking? I am Nero tol Scaeva, master engineer─the mechanical genius who restored the Ultima Weapon to full operational capacity! And, as luck would have it, I am graciously offering you the use of my considerable expertise.

Cid

-- And, what, you just expect us to accept? You're a fool if you think your deeds at the Crystal Tower were enough to win my trust, Nero.

Nero

-- Trust? You wound me, Garlond! All those years studying side by side at the Academy, sharing both trial and triumph. We were countrymen, once, you and I.

-- But sentiment aside─have you a better solution? Or do you mean to send in your vaunted hero there, as you always do, and pray the world is not engulfed in flame?

-- Let us approach the problem in a rational manner. Does not the fact that Omega slumbers in stasis point to the existence of some overriding technology? A means of control?

Kan-E-Senna

-- I would ask a question, if I may─Nero, was it not? In the event that we succeeded in using Omega to shackle the primal in the manner you propose, what then would become of it? Do we not risk repeating the mistakes of the Allagans?

Nero

-- Omega is but a tool. How we choose to employ that tool is entirely up to us. Of course, if you would rather leave it buried beneath Carteneau while you continue your petty squabbles above, then I suppose that is also your choice.

Cid

-- Spare us, Nero! The Seedseer's concern is a valid one. He who controls Omega wields the power of the gods. The very power which led the Allagans to destroy themselves.

Nero

-- And does it not fall to we engineers to prevent such misuse? What was your company's proud slogan? “Freedom through Technology”?

Cid

-- Hah. A creed you follow, is it?

-- <sigh> What say you? Do we take this villain at his word?

Me

-- (He makes a convincing case.)

Cid

-- He makes me grind my teeth is what he does, but I suppose we don't have much of a choice.

-- Would the council be willing to entrust this matter to a pair of former imperials?

Kan-E-Senna

-- Yes. The task of restoring the Allagan relic will be yours. But the responsibility for its reawakening must remain with the council. Do we condone this course of action?

Raugahn

-- Aye. 'Twould seem we do. Let the records show that we invest this contingent with the authority to enter Carteneau and take command of Omega.

-- Cid, I appoint you leader of the expedition. Scions─I would ask that you assign some few of your number to escort Master Garlond and supervise the other one.

Alphinaud

-- We should be happy to oblige. The politics of Carteneau being what they are, I daresay our neutrality will prove useful in avoiding any unnecessary entanglements.

Alisaie

-- If I am not mistaken, Doma occupies a similarly neutral position. Might we not persuade you to join the expedition, Lady Yugiri? If you suspected any foul play from Nero, you would be welcome to kill him.

Yugiri

-- My blade is yours.

Nero

-- Not a moment's hesitation, eh? You'll forgive me if I do not shake your hand.

--------------------------------------

Alphinaud

-- Well, that was a rather unexpected development, and one which raises a number of questions...not least among them how Nero chanced to learn of the council meeting in the first place.

After receiving a timely message via linkpearl, Alisaie informs you that the Alliance council will soon be reconvening in Gridania. Make your way to Nophica's Altar, and announce your arrival to the silent conjurer.

As the council debates how best to combat the incalculable threat contained within the cocoon of light, an unexpected figure seizes his moment to take the stage: Nero tol Scaeva. The disgraced imperial engineer proceeds to proffer what might kindly be termed a “bold” solution to the problem, and is duly ridiculed by Cid. The Alliance leaders, however, are not so quick to dismiss the man's proposal, anything being preferable to another Calamity, and they grudgingly agree to send a contingent to awaken the infamous Allagan weapon known as “Omega.” Trouble Alphinaud for his thoughts on this surprising turn of events.

It is plain that Alphinaud harbors grave misgivings about the timing of Nero's reappearance. Press him on how best to proceed.

# The Greater Obeisance🎧

System Guide

-- Alphinaud is eager to join Cid and the others.

Alphinaud

-- Cid and the others are assembling at the airship landing. Alisaie is already on her way, and it would not do to lag too far behind. Let us be off.

-- Where is everyone...?

Cid

-- Luna, Alphinaud! Ready to go? The others have stepped out onto the landing for a moment, lest you wonder. Nero insisted that he be allowed to inspect the Excelsior before boarding.

Alphinaud

-- And you let him? Despite his very timely offer of assistance, the thought of that man poking about in the workings of the ship without proper supervision does not fill me with confidence.

Cid

-- Calm yourself, Alphinaud─your sister was adamant that he would never leave her sight. She and Yugiri are─ Ah, well here they are now.

-- Right, I think that's everyone. Shall I set course for Carteneau?

Alphinaud

-- Ah, might I ask that we delay our departure slightly? I require no more than a few hours at most. Our colleagues are studying the cocoon even as we speak, and I would hear their latest observations ere we proceed. It would seem wise to gain as clear an understanding of the situation as possible before formulating our plan.

Nero

-- Oh? I thought time was against us! How foolish of me.

Alisaie

-- Hold your tongue. When we want your opinion, we'll ask for it.

Nero

-- Forgive me, my lady! I shall keep my counsel until such time as you have finished procrastinating.

Cid

-- All right. While Alphinaud speaks with his colleagues, I shall fly the Excelsior over to Mor Dhona, and we can reconvene at the Rising Stones.

Alphinaud

-- Mine apologies for the trouble. I shall visit Y'shtola and the others forthwith, and join you as soon as I am able. Luna, pray accompany Alisaie back to the Rising Stones. I should feel safer knowing you are present to entertain our “guest.”

Cid

-- Right. Everyone heading to Mor Dhona is welcome to travel aboard the Excelsior. I'll clear things with the girl at the counter here. Let her know when you're ready to leave.

Hida

-- You are traveling with Master Garlond, miss? The Enterprise Excelsior is right this way.

Nero

-- What manner of airship has no private cabins!? Then again, I suppose Garlond had to find somewhere to stow his half-baked inventions...

Alisaie

-- Strange though it may seem, Nero's former loyalties do not trouble me. But I can see why people are loath to lower their guard around him.

Yugiri

-- I do not care for that man...

Cid

-- Not quite a door-to-door service, but I couldn't exactly land her in the Toll's main square... Shall we adjourn to the Rising Stones, then?

Tataru

-- I know Nero's a guest here, but we don't exactly have the happiest history with the Empire, do we? So my question to you is: do I offer him tea?

Yugiri

-- Fear not. I shall keep a close eye on our new ally.

Alisaie

-- One was created to capture Bahamut and the other to surpass him... Which will prove the stronger, I wonder.

Cid

-- We must be careful, old friend. The walking weapons of Allag were expressly designed to subdue primals, but men like Gaius will always seek to use them against mankind. It falls to us to ensure that Omega is never employed as a weapon of war. In the wrong hands, it would be... It would be bad.

F'lhaminn

-- Hoary Boulder and his companions left to continue reconnaissance on the beast tribes. They were adamant about shouldering what burdens they could while the senior Scions were occupied with this “cocoon” emergency.

Nero

-- Hm. So these are the fabled headquarters of the Scions... I confess, I would have expected an order of self-proclaimed warrior-scholars to surround themselves with the fruits of man's enlightenment. And yet there is not so much as a single piece of magitek in sight.

-- It never ceases to amaze me how primitive you Eorzeans truly are...

Tataru

-- Hmph! I'll have you know that the Rising Stones is home to the very latest in magitek innovation. Wedge calls it the “Mark XIV Thermocoil Boilmaster,” and it's the finest kettle I've ever had the pleasure to own.

Alphinaud

-- We are returned.

-- Well, Yda and I, at least. Y'shtola and the others remained behind to continue their assessment of the binding magick.

Yda

-- There didn't seem much point staying just for that, so I decided to come back with Alphinaud. Papalymo bought us this time. We shouldn't waste it.

Gosetsu

-- By your leave!

Alisaie

-- Good gods. That voice could fell a gigas...

Gosetsu

-- This is the Rising Stones, domicile of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn? I enter at the invitation of one Lord Urianger!

-- Ho-ho! I spy you there, shadow walker. You always were a hard one to find!

Alisaie

-- Yugiri...? Do you know this man?

Yugiri

-- Gosetsu!? Why are you come to Eorzea?

Gosetsu

-- In search of you, Yugiri! For days and nights did I row across the angry sea... I made port in good spirits, only for my own flesh to betray me over the trifling matter of an empty belly! Collapsed in the street like an unfed stray, I was, until Lord Urianger came to my aid. Over a most welcome meal, we spoke of the plight of Doma, and I learned of our displaced countrymen's work to resettle this blighted land. 'Twas blind fortune I was able to locate you so swiftly!

-- But now we must make ready to depart! Our master languishes in dire peril, and Doma calls her daughter home!

Yugiri

-- It is not so simple, Gosetsu. There are obligations which bind me here...

Gosetsu

-- You─ You refuse? Did you mislay your oath during your flight from our homeland? The laws of hospitality must be honored, but surely the vow to defend your master demands the greater obeisance!

Yugiri

-- It was our master who bid me guide our people to safe haven by any means necessary. And it was the Scions you see before you who provided us succor and sanctuary when all others refused.

-- Dire peril or no, were I to return without first repaying such “hospitality,” our master would cut me down at the threshold.

Gosetsu

-- Mayhap that is so...

Yugiri

-- There is more. A crisis threatens all within this realm, Eorzean and Doman alike, and I go to play my part in its resolution. I will not bring shame upon our liege by abandoning my people or my duty.

Nero

-- How very noble of you. Now, in the name of honor, kinship, and─ah, yes─practicality, might I suggest we get this expedition underway? Or would you rather debate the finer points of duty and leave Omega to the Empire?

Gosetsu

-- The Empire!? Yugiri? You draw steel against the curs of Garlemald?

-- Then why did you not say so!? My blade is oathbound to fall upon the ranks of the imperials wheresoever they march! Lead on, shadow walker. And may the enemy tremble at our coming!

I've only just this moment finished the stitching, but I wanted you to have it before you left. Here!  You can try it on right now, if you like!

-- Assuming we measured correctly, the fit should be just right. Snug but not too snug, if you know what I mean...? Sooo...how does it feel?

-- You're not just saying that, are you!? Oh, I can't tell you how much this means to me! To have crafted something worthy of the Warrior of Light is... It's─ Well, let's just say it makes all the practice worthwhile. I also sewed in a blood pearl charm to...you know...bring you home. May it always protect you.

Nero

-- The “Mark XIV Thermocoil Boilmaster”? Dear me... How risible must the previous thirteen iterations have been? I could design a more efficient water heater in the time it took that ill-conceived lump to become lukewarm.

Tataru

-- How dare he mock the Scions like that!? If I ever had to sew a set of traveling clothes for him, I just might forget to take out the pins.

Cid

-- Oh, I think he's going to fit right in.

Alisaie

-- Truly, I had no idea Domans could be so loud. He and Yugiri could hardly be more different...

Alphinaud

-- Just the two unexpected guests, then. Still, I suspect that each will prove useful in his own way.

Yugiri

-- Never did I think to hear Gosetsu's voice echo through these halls...

Gosetsu

-- My blade shall carve a path through the Empire's ranks as a scythe fells stalks of wheat!

Alphinaud informs you that the Omega contingent is assembling at the airship landing. Make haste and join Cid and the others.

Cid seems bent on heading directly for Carteneau, but Alphinaud requests a short delay to confirm the situation in the East Shroud before departing. Having acquiesced to Alphinaud's wish, Cid offers to fly the remaining members of the contingent to Mor Dhona. Speak with Hida at the landing gate when you are ready to board the Enterprise Excelsior.

After a brief flight, you arrive a short distance from the walls of Revenant's Toll. Speak with Cid before making your way into town.

Cid apologizes for not being able to land within the settlement proper, and suggests that you all retire to the Rising Stones. Perhaps this would be a suitable place to approach Nero, and learn more of your unexpected ally...

Alphinaud returns from the East Shroud accompanied by Yda, but the melancholy mood which descends at her mention of Papalymo is swiftly shattered by the booming entrance of Gosetsu. The samurai has arrived with dire news from Doma, but far from persuading Yugiri to return to her homeland, he is instead convinced by Nero's mention of the Empire to join the mission to Carteneau. Speak with Yda when you are ready to set forth.
