-- Papalymo has a mind to learn the Griffin's true intentions.

Papalymo

-- If, as you suspect, the Griffin is indeed plotting to summon a primal, we must needs obtain confirmation while there is yet time to act. To that end, I propose we question his double. Given his role as the group's de facto mouthpiece, I should not be surprised if he were one of the Griffin's closest associates. And while he may not be aware of the most sensitive details, he can probably tell us the Masks' plans in broad strokes. Like the man whom he impersonates, however, he is wary of outsiders. He will not expose himself without a suitable incentive.

-- My plan is as follows: you and Alphinaud will pose as adventurers fallen on hard times, inspired by his words to take up arms for a noble cause. Yda and I, as members of the Resistance, will recount tales of your past achievements, and testify as to your usefulness in the struggles ahead. With our enthusiastic assurances still ringing in his ears, he will decide to welcome you in person, and we will arrange a meeting.

-- You will need to look the part that we might maintain the charade─until we have him cornered, at least. Here─this should be enough to purchase suitable garments from Talebot, and to have him rub a respectable amount of dirt on them for good measure. Any questions?

Alphinaud

-- It all seems simple enough, thank you. And with that, Luna, let us be off!

Papalymo

-- Talebot has an assortment of affordable clothing which he sells to the refugees. The sum in that sack should more than suffice, but if it and my name are not enough to secure his cooperation, pay him double. I shall see that you are recompensed.

Yda

-- Our identities will be revealed, but it can't be helped. We don't have time for a cleverer approach.

Alisaie

-- Oh, don't mind me. Just waiting for our fashionably late bard... You seem rather busy, so I won't keep you.

Sack of Gil (Item)

-- A heavy leather pouch entrusted to you by Papalymo. Not all problems can be solved with a fistful of gil. For the rest, one must needs resort to a sack.

Alphinaud

-- Well, don't look at me. You are the one with the sack of gil. ...You do have the sack of gil, don't you?

Talebot

-- Eh? You want to buy what? I don't know what you're up to, but I want no part of it.

-- Well, you're the ones with the gil, and seein' as you're friends of Papalymo... There. Tunic and slops for the both of you, tailored and, er...treated to your tastes. Now, off with you, before someone sees us together.

-- ...Don't tell me you lost 'em? Thal's balls, woman! <sigh> I'll give you another set if you did─but let's not make a habit of this.

Alphinaud

-- "Clothes maketh the man,“ as they say. Right, then. I will go and change, and see you at the spot Papalymo marked on our maps.

-------------------------

Alphinaud

-- Why are you not wearing the clothes Talebot gave you? They could be here at any moment! If by some curious and inexplicable twist of fate you have mislaid them, go back to him and request another set. But for the love of the Twelve, do it quickly!

-- Well, look at us─a pair of down-at-heel adventurers seeking a chance to recapture past glories. Yes, this should suffice. And now we play the waiting game...

The False Griffin

-- My thanks, comrades.

-- You must be the esteemed adventurers of whom I have heard so much. I understand you have taken an interest in our cause.

Alphinaud

-- 	A great interest, you might say. Your words have certainly made quite an impression on my friend and I. The Resistance has long─and some would say wisely─avoided open engagements with the Garleans, but you and yours seem confident against the world in arms.

-- I can only assume you have good reason to be so bold. Why, one might even think you were planning to summon a primal. Because that would do much to explain the sizable shipment of crystals you recently received from your smuggler friends─whom our Ishgardian allies have since detained, lest you wonder.

Yda

-- I'd like to hear more about the Griffin. The real Griffin. Your performance earlier didn't fool us!

The False Griffin

-- Ah. The famous Scions of the Seventh Dawn. I should have known better than to think I could conceal the truth from you lot. You are right. I am not the Griffin. But I speak with his voice, and it was at his behest that we procured those crystals.

-- You are wrong, however, if you think that we procured them to summon a primal. We used them to reach an accord with the Amalj'aa. In exchange for crystals to summon their god, they will aid us in the fight for Ala Mhigan liberation.

Yda

-- You've got to be joking! Have you gone completely mad!? When people find out you helped the lizardmen summon Ifrit, they'll turn on the Resistance! Ala Mhigo will never be free!

The False Griffin

-- This isn't a faerie tale, girl. We don't have the luxury to play at being honorable heroes. It's because the likes of you wouldn't sully your saintly hands that Ala Mhigo's been under the yoke for the past twenty years! But the Griffin won't stand for it, and neither will we! We're ready to do whatever it takes!

Papalymo

-- What proof do you have of this arrangement with the Amalj'aa?

The False Griffin

-- What, aside from a lack of crystals? None. But the beastmen have a great big pile of the things, if you fancy looking. You might want to hurry, though─it'll not be long before they summon their god. Search our camp if you don't believe me. We have naught to hide.

Papalymo

-- If there is a cache to be found, Yda and I will find it.

The False Griffin

-- Then let us be off.

-- Are you perchance the Warrior of Light?

-- Aye, I thought so. You should know that a great many who have joined us did so because you saved them─because you showed them that one brave woman can make a difference. You saved me too, once. Helped a friend over in Quarrymill make some medicine I needed. But that was a lifetime ago...On behalf of my brothers and sisters, I thank you. You gave us hope where there was none; courage and strength when all was lost. We shall not squander your gift.

Papalymo

-- I know that look, Yda, and I do not like it. You cannot seriously be contemplating taking up arms with that band of cutthroats?

Yda

-- I... I just...

Papalymo

-- If the Griffin and his men have their way, it is only a matter of time before the situation in Ala Mhigo comes to a head. Your homeland's future teeters on a knife-edge, and any reckless action, however small, could have irrevocable consequences.

-- You mustn't lose sight of that, Yda. When the time comes, we must all make our choices, but we must do so in full possession of the facts. Now let us away─there is work to be done.

Alphinaud

-- Quarrymill, he said? Do you remember...? Forgive me. You cannot be expected to recall every name and face, and besides, it's not as if it matters.  I have long admired how you live in the present. How you focus on the problems at hand and always keep moving forward. So let us keep moving forward together, Luna. We must find and secure those crystals─this is no time for looking back.

Papalymo surmises that the Ala Mhigan posing as the Griffin may well be one of Resistance leader's closest associates, and party to his master's overarching plan. Like the Griffin himself, however, the man is wary of strangers, and will need to be lured out if you are to question him. That being the case, Papalymo would have you and Alphinaud pose as adventurers fallen on hard times who have been inspired by his words to take up arms for the Resistance. While he and Yda convince the masked impostor of your worthiness, you and Alphinaud are to purchase suitably filthy garments from a refugee named Talebot using the funds Papalymo has provided.

Talebot is more than happy to supply you with worn-out, dirt-stained garments in exchange for nothing more than a sack of gil and a promise to tell him nothing of your intentions. Having agreed to the man's terms, Alphinaud regards his new used tunic and slops with a mixture of excitement and horror.

Having obtained your disguises, you need only change and wait with Alphinaud outside Little Ala Mhigo until the false Griffin arrives. Of course, this may prove difficult should you somehow misplace the weathered tunic and slops...but considering the rather large sum you paid Talebot, he should have little reason to deny you another set.

Yda and Papalymo arrive at the appointed hour, along with the masked impostor and a single bodyguard. Swiftly dispensing with any attempt at subterfuge, Alphinaud accuses the Griffin and his Masks of conspiring to summon a primal. At once, the man identifies you all as members of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, and rather admirably proceeds to refute your accusations, calmly explaining that the crystals were traded with the Amalj'aa in exchange for their aid in battle against the Garleans. When Yda scolds him for striking such a shortsighted bargain, however, he explodes in anger, declaring that the Griffin and his loyal Masks will do whatever it takes to win Ala Mhigo's freedom. Regaining his composure, he invites you to search his camp for the crystals if you doubt his word, and Papalymo accepts. But before the revolutionary takes his leave, he spares a moment to thank you for a kindness performed long ago by which he was saved, and for being a symbol of hope to the hopeless far and wide. “We shall not squander your gift,” he says, leaving you to wonder what responsibility you bear for the actions of those whose lives you have touched.

The repercussions of our actions can never be predicted in their entirety. In saving a life, do we doom a hundred more? And, if so, would the correct choice be not to intervene? Alphinaud has no patience for such questions of cosmic justice or morality this day, and would rather concentrate on the problems at hand─as you so often do. “This is no time for looking back,” he says, and a part of you agrees─and yet...

System Guide

-- Alphinaud would keep moving forward.

Alphinaud

-- If we take the Griffin's double at his word, then the crystals are now somewhere within Zahar'ak...ready to be put to use by the Amalj'aa. We must apprise Alisaie of all we have learned. I will join you both in Little Ala Mhigo after I have changed.

Thancred

-- Kept you waiting, eh? My apologies.

Alphinaud

-- Ahh, that's much better. Subterfuge was never my strong suit. You are prepared for battle, then?

Alisaie

-- Now that Thancred has finally arrived, mayhap you could share your latest findings?

Thancred

-- You mean to tell me that while we were worrying ourselves sick, Yda and Papalymo were here all along? Well, Y'shtola will be relieved. And also angry. Mainly angry, I should think.

-- As for the crystals, what choice do we have? We cannot very well leave them in the hands of the Amalj'aa. For all we know, they could be preparing to summon Ifrit even as we speak. We must make for Zahar'ak without delay.

Alphinaud

-- Agreed. If there is naught else to discuss, let us depart at once.

Urianger

-- ...And so they go forth, in accordance with the Griffin's plan. The players gather to assume their marks on a stage wreathed in flame... Ere long, the curtain shall rise, and the drama of which I am author, gods forgive me, shall at last be performed. Naught else remaineth, save to stand at the ready and pray that the chance is seized. For never shall we know its like again.

-----------------------------

Thancred

-- You'd think there would be more obvious signs that something was afoot─but, if anything, the place seems quieter than I remember it. I have a bad feeling about this...

Alisaie

-- All seems calm here. Is it possible that we've been deceived?

Alphinaud

-- I confess, I expected a warmer greeting. But we must not jump to conclusions─not until we have braved the Bowl of Embers.

-- We must be ready to engage the enemy at any moment. If you would make any final preparations, pray do so now. I shall await your signal.

Thancred

-- This isn't right. The Amalj'aa would never leave this place so poorly guarded.

Alisaie

-- Not willingly, no.

Ardbert (Warrior of Darkness)

-- Hah hah! Ahhh, the saviors of Eorzea. Slow as ever.

Alphinaud

-- By the Twelve... Will you never learn?

Ardbert (Warrior of Darkness)

-- You know, you're right. Mayhap it is time for a change of tack. Killing primals, tormenting beastmen, hastening the birth of a new god... It's all a bit much, isn't it? And, frankly, we don't have the leisure to do it. Killing the Warrior of Light, on the other hand─that would soon plunge Eorzea into chaos.

-- One life for one world. A fair exchange─wouldn't you agree!?

Thancred

-- Lest you forget, you've more than one opponent!

Alphinaud

-- Carbuncle, defend me!

Renda-Rae (Ranger of Darkness)

-- I sense you will offer more than mere target practice. Unlike your sister.

Alphinaud

-- Alisaie

Alisaie

-- Did...did I not tell you, Alphinaud? I am not the girl I once was. My brother was always the clever one, while my talents lay elsewhere...

-- As Eorzea's blade of Light once stood by my side, now I shall stand at her─and defend this realm with all my might!

Ardbert (Warrior of Darkness)

-- Let's finish this!

Ardbert (Warrior of Darkness)

-- It ends, now!

Alphinaud

-- The chains!

Ardbert (Warrior of Darkness)

-- You snake. You would betray us as well?

Urianger

-- He that holdeth fast unto his convictions shall never count betrayal amongst his crimes, though all the world may call him villain. My path is unchanged; my creed sacrosanct. This I believe with all my heart. But say, Warrior of Darkness, and speak true─what dost thou believe? That rendering up the souls of thy world in service to the Rejoining will grant it salvation? Nay.

Alphinaud

-- By the Twelve─Urianger!

Urianger

-- Mine apologies, Master Alphinaud. That the brightest light might shine, duty did compel me to walk in darkest shade.

Alisaie

-- You sweet fool. I was almost willing to believe you had turned against us. I expect a full explanation when this is over. For now, may I assume you have turned your cloak for the last time?

Urianger

-- Thou mayest, my lady.

-- By thy leave.

Ardbert (Warrior of Darkness)

-- Even odds, then. No matter. We'll crush the lot of you in one fell swoop!

Nyelbert (Magus of Darkness)

-- Understood.

Alisaie

-- Hearken to me! We only have one chance! Channel your aether into my blade that I might strike before the mage casts his spell! I cannot do it alone, but together...together we can defeat them!

-- Make ready! They come!

Alphinaud

-- Alisaie! Are you hurt?

Alisaie

-- A touch dizzy, but otherwise fine. Thank you.

Thancred

-- And there you have it. Our friend is too stubborn to die.

Ardbert (Warrior of Darkness)

-- Hmph. We are far from finished.

-- Or have you never considered how we came to this world?

Thancred

-- Crystals? You mean...like the Ascians?

Urianger

-- Just so. As the Ascians flee unto the rift 'twixt planes with Crystals of Darkness, so did these warriors come hither with Crystals of Light.

Ardbert (Warrior of Darkness)

-- Eloquent, as always. Aye, like the Ascians, we too are beyond death! You cannot defeat that which is eternal!

Alphinaud

-- Wait!

-- Such methods as the Ascians employ require the renunciation of the flesh. You...you would have had to...

Ardbert (Warrior of Darkness)

-- At long last, you see. To save our world, we gave our lives. We were just adventurers trying to make our way. An odd job here, a favor there─we never aspired to be Warriors of Light. But word of our deeds spread, and soon people were calling us heroes. They placed their hopes and dreams on our shoulders and bid us fight for all that was good and right.

-- We fought and we fought and we fought...until there was no one left to fight. We won...and now our world is being erased from existence.

-- We did everything right, everything that was asked of us, and still─still it came to this! You of all people should understand! We cannot─we will not falter. We brought our world to the brink of destruction, and now we must save it.

Branden (Knight of Darkness)

-- I've died before, Arbert. I'm not afraid to die again.

Lamitt (Devout of Darkness)

-- No matter how many times we fall, we must rise and carry on the fight. For those we left behind.

-- To have known the depths of sorrow and embrace the highest sacrifice─nonetheless...Master Louisoix, guide my hand, I pray you, as fate's thread spinneth upon this most capricious spindle.

Urianger

-- Quickly! Thou must needs invoke the power of thy crystal!

Alphinaud

-- What is this place?

Hydaelyn

-- Such pain... Such sorrow... Oh, my dear children...

Thancred

-- I-It can't be!

Urianger

-- Mother Hydaelyn, hearken unto Your children's plea! From two worlds do we gather, and from two worlds do we offer a bounty of Light. In this desperate hour, we do beseech Your intercession! We beg an audience with the Word of the Mother─with Your chosen, Minfilia!

Hydaelyn

-- Your cries go not unheard... Nor your sacrifices unnoticed... Though many are lost, there are those we can yet save... Whom I can yet save...

Alphinaud

-- Minfilia!

The Word of the Mother

-- Blessed children of the First. The light of your world hath grown blinding in its radiance, but it is not yet absolute. I will hie me to your world and there take unto myself the Light which riseth even now to drown it, as Darkness once did drown another.

Ardbert (Warrior of Darkness)

-- Now you deign to answer our prayers!? I will suffer this farce no longer!

Minfilia

-- As the Ascians must serve as instruments of Zodiark's will, so too must others carry out the will of Hydaelyn. But for the boon you have granted Her, She has grown strong enough to set me free, that I might serve as Her emissary. Your suffering, your sacrifice, your supplications─She has heard all. We will not let the First fall to Light.

-- Thank you, Urianger, for bringing everyone here. It fills my heart with joy to look upon the faces of my friends once more.

Urianger

-- In taking you unto Her bosom, I knew that Hydaelyn had bequeathed to you a sliver of Her grace, granting you strength long sought.

-- And in treating with the Ascians, I learned of a star like unto our own─a doomed world of fallen heroes, in whom I glimpsed ourselves. The First. Full long did I search for a means to save this world, concluding at the last that the answer lay in the power of blessed crystals. And thus did I labor to set Light against Dark. Yet I knew from the beginning that this salvation would not come without sacrifice, for the instrument of the First's deliverance would of necessity be required to journey thither...there to remain, mayhap forever.

Alphinaud

-- You orchestrated all of this not to save her, but to send her away!?

Urianger

-- One life for one world. Such was the bargain, and you the coin, though it were not mine to spend.

Minfilia

-- Have we not walked together in the light of the Crystal, and at Her bidding borne witness to the joys and sorrows of this land? Each and every one of you knows my heart. If this be the price I must pay, I pay it gladly.

Thancred

-- ...You would go alone then?

Minfilia

-- My dearest Thancred... You who have ever watched over me... I am truly grateful for all you have done on my behalf, as would my father be. Your kindness, your compassion, your love... These are your gifts to me, and our gifts to them, forming a bond which transcends time and space.

Thancred

-- Sometimes I forget you are not the child I once knew. Make me proud.

Minfilia

-- Long have I watched you from Hydaelyn's side. Watched as you nurtured and kept safe the light of the dawn. The dark recesses of the world hide untold secrets and dangers. Thus do I entrust to you Tupsimati. I pray you keep to the path that you may never have need of it.

Nyelbert (Magus of Darkness)

-- 'Twould seem the power of our crystals is all but spent. Perhaps...if there is naught else to be done...

Ardbert (Warrior of Darkness)

-- Hear me, servant of Hydaelyn. If you would have us place our trust in you, then I would ask a favor. Take us with you. Take us home.

-- We were blind to the truth once. So I tell you this, as one fool to another. Light, Dark, it doesn't matter. What matters is how you choose to use them. We made our choice, and you see what came of it. So please...forge a different path. Seize a better fate.

Minfilia

-- 'Tis a strange feeling. So many times have I watched you depart, my heart filled with worry, and ever did you return to me in triumph. Someday, when I have found a way to free this star from Her sorrow, I promise you I shall repay the favor.

Minfilia

-- Thank you, Lhaminn...for everything...

Thancred

Urianger

-- ...Speak thy mind. I do not expect thy forgiveness. 

Alphinaud

-- ...It would seem we are in southern Thanalan again. Minfilia's doing, no doubt. May the Twelve speed her on her way...and the Warriors of Darkness too. I cannot help but wonder what awaits those wayward souls. If they gave their lives in order to travel to the Source, then in returning to the First, would they not...? ...But mayhap that was their wish.

Alisaie

If the false Griffin is to be believed, the crystals you seek are somewhere within the stronghold of Zahar'ak, where the Amalj'aa are presumably preparing to summon Ifrit. Given the gravity of the threat, you have no choice but to gather your comrades and proceed there at once. Alisaie has been waiting for Thancred for some time; hopefully the bard has finally arrived.

You tell Thancred and Alisaie of your recent reunion with Yda and Papalymo, and of your subsequent encounter with the false Griffin. At the mention of Ifrit's name, they agree without hesitation that you must make haste to the home of the Amalj'aa, for the Scions of the Seventh Dawn are duty-bound to combat the primal menace wheresoever it may arise.

Strangely, there appear to be no signs of increased activity, or anything else which might indicate that the Amalj'aa are preparing to summon Ifrit. Could it be that the false Griffin has made a fool of you? And if so, to what end? Though you are sorely tempted to march directly back to the Masks' camp, you must first complete your search, for only by venturing into the Bowl of Embers can you know for certain whether or not a ritual is taking place.

To your horror, you find the bodies of countless Amalj'aa waiting for you within the Bowl of Embers, and standing over them the Warriors of Darkness. This time, however, they are come not to slay a primal, but you, the Warrior of Light, in the belief that your death will plunge the realm into chaos and bring about another Umbral Calamity. They duly attack, but your allies are quick to rush to your defense─not least Alisaie, who conjures an aetheric blade before joining the fray.

The battle rages for a time, and eventually you feel the tide turning in your favor. But, in that instant, your counterpart unleashes a potent binding magic, and you and your allies suddenly find yourselves at the mercy of your opponents. Before they can administer the coup de grâce, however, Urianger appears from nowhere, and breaks the aetheric chains around you, revealing himself to have manipulated the Warriors of Darkness as a double agent. With the odds now even, the battle resumes, your enemies fighting with every onze of their strength to take your life.

When the dust finally settles, only you and yours remain standing. However, even in defeat, the Warriors of Darkness remain defiant, drawing forth Crystals of Light and proclaiming that you cannot defeat that which is eternal. It is then that Alphinaud realizes the horrible truth: these desperate men and women of the First are already dead. Bowing his head, their leader declares that they were humble adventurers chosen by the Mothercrystal to serve as Warriors of Light. They did everything that was asked of them, and yet, for all their efforts, and all their many triumphs, their world still fell to ruin. With naught left to say, they raise their crystals high, resolved to withdraw that they might one day return to carry on the fight. Seeing this, however, Urianger enjoins you to raise up your own Crystal of Light, and as it glows brighter and brighter in your hands, its radiance begins to blend with that of the others, until all is swallowed by incandescent, blinding white...

You open your eyes to find yourself in the aetherial sea, a familiar voice echoing in your ears. As the others struggle to comprehend what has happened, Urianger raises his hands to the heavens and cries out to Mother Hydaelyn, beseeching Her to grant you an audience with Minfilia in exchange for this bounty of Light. In answer, the Word of the Mother appears and addresses the fallen heroes of the First, declaring that she will travel to their world and draw the abundant Light unto herself, thus redressing the balance. Driven mad by this seemingly impossible reversal of fortunes, their leader makes to strike her down, but she halts his charge with a gesture, assuring him that she speaks true, and that his world will not fall to Light.

Turning to you and your allies, she then speaks as Minfilia once more, thanking Urianger for allowing her to see so many of her dearest friends one last time. His voice quavering, the Archon confesses to having orchestrated events to grant Minfilia her freedom, that she might then use her newfound powers to prevent the First from being lost to the void. Though this revelation prompts outrage in your allies, she reassures them that she is happy to have been given such an opportunity. As a final gesture, she entrusts to you Louisoix's broken staff, Tupsimati, praying that you will never have need of it.

Their journey at an end, the broken Warriors of Light have a simple request for your departing friend: “Take us with you. Take us home.” And so you bid farewell to them, and to brave Minfilia, who promises that one day, when she has found a way to free this star of her sorrow, she will return, just as you have always returned from your many adventures.

You cannot say when or how you all arrived back in Thanalan, but you are certain it was Minfilia's doing. While turning the day's events over in his mind, Alphinaud takes a moment to consider the fate of the Warriors of Darkness. If they were already dead, he reasons, a return to the First may very well mean their permanent demise... But perhaps, after all they had endured, that was their wish.
