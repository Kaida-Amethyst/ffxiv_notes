## Part 1

Owing to schemes in the shadows of Ul'dah, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn have been scattered, and the Warrior of Light has been forced to flee north. Though granted shelter by Lord Haurchefant, the heroes must press on to Ishgard. But what trials await in this reclusive nation, locked in a never-ending struggle with dragons?

## Part II

Venturing deep into the domain of the dragons, the heroes come face-to-face with the great wyrm Hraesvelgr, from whom they learn the sordid truth of the Dragonsong War. Born of man's treachery was this bloody conflict, and by man's hand it must be ended. Thus does the Warrior of Light sally forth with Ishgard's greatest champion, the Azure Dragoon, on a mission to crush the serpent's head.

## Part III

Though it came at great cost, the heroes have triumphed over the archbishop on the floating continent of Azys Lla, thereby breaking the cycle of conflict between man and dragon. Yet a millennium of war is not soon ended, and in the wake of the Warrior of Light's return, the nation of Ishgard was left trembling, the faith of her people shaken to the very core.

## Part IV

After a thousand years of bloodshed and sorrow, the shade of Nidhogg, rage incarnate, fell at last to the Warrior of Light. So it was that the Dragonsong War drew to a close, and the survivors, bloodied but unbowed, could begin to pick up the pieces. A new day dawns in Ishgard, and her champions may rest easyâ”€if only for a moment. For every ending marks a new beginning.
