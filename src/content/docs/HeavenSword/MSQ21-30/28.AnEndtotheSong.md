## An End to the Song🎧

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Aymeric is desperate to fly to Ishgard's defense.

Aymeric

-- Ishgard will not last long against Nidhogg and his Horde. We must away!
</div>

‍

<div class="border-4 p-6">
Hraesvelgr

-- Know you, then, what this roar portendeth?

Aymeric

-- Aye. I must return to my city without delay.

Hraesvelgr

-- Then we shall lend you our wings. Let us meet with Nidhogg on the field of battle, and together bring an end to his wrathful song.

-------------------------------------------------

Lucia

-- Remember your training! We hold fast until the lord commander returns!\

-- Ugh... We must hold...

Artoirel

-- Reinforcements! By the Fury... That one is the size of Nidhogg!

Lucia

-- Lord Commander!

Artoirel

-- You are late, Warrior of Light!

Nidhogg

-- Wherefore standest thou with these vermin, Brother?

Hraesvelgr

-- Abandon this war, shade.

-- The suffering thou sowest serveth no end. The traitors' progeny have learned of their forefathers' betrayal, and seek now to make amends with our kind. Never shall our grief be assuaged nor our loss forgotten, but reconciliation may yet halt the spread of this plague of enmity. Forsake thy vengeance and be at peace.

Nidhogg

-- What soft-headed ramblings are these? Thy dalliance with that vile maid hath robbed thee of thy wits! Mayhap her cloying perfume hath made thee forget the stench of our brood-sister's lifeblood!

Hraesvelgr

-- Thou darest speak thus of my beloved!?

Nidhogg

-- Ah! So the flames of rage may yet be kindled! I feared thy heart's fire had long since gone out. But waste not thy fury on words, Brother─thou shalt have need of it for the battle!

-------------------------------------------------

Hraesvelgr

-- Guh!

Nidhogg

-- Thou art weak, Hraesvelgr─a slithering wyrm who fawneth on the vermin who should rightly be his prey. For a thousand years have I fought without cease─and thou didst think to prevail against me!

Hraesvelgr

-- Glory not in thy victory, shade. The battle...is not yet won. My power─and my hope─have I entrusted to another...

Nidhogg

-- Thine eye! What hast thou done!?

-- Fool! Thou wouldst trust a mortal with thy strength!?

-- I know thee... 'Twas thou who didst intrude upon my lair and best the half of me. But now I am whole, and naught in creation shall deny me my vengeance!

Nidhogg

-- Is this...to be...mine end? Nay... I will not allow it... I am of the first brood... I am vengeance incarnate... I am Nidhogg!

-- Thou shalt die by my hand!

Estinien

Nidhogg

-- Thou...wilt...obey!

Estinien

-- I would ask one last favor of you, Warrior of Light... Finish me─now, while I have the beast subdued!

-- You waste your time. Kill me! It is the only way! Ending Nidhogg...will be my final duty...

Alphinaud

-- No! You can't die like this! I won't let you!

Aymeric

-- Allow me to do this much, at least...

Hraesvelgr

-- The Horde have sensed the fall of their master, and scattered to the winds.

Aymeric

-- You have my gratitude, Hraesvelgr. Your deeds this day have saved a great many lives.

Hraesvelgr

-- Then our alliance hath served its purpose.

-- Thou didst wield the power I granted thee well. 'Twas thine own skill and not mine eye which earned thee victory.

-- I wish thy companion a swift recovery. Fare you well, children of man.

Alphinaud

-- The battle is won. We can do no more for Estinien now than bear him home and wish him well, even as Hraesvelgr did. The rest we must trust to the hands of the healers and the grace of the gods.

You and your companions settle upon the backs of Hraesvelgr and his kin, and dive through the clouds in the direction of Ishgard. Soon after, you alight, hands numb and eyes stinging, on the Steps of Faith in the midst of battle. With a mixture of surprise and scorn, Nidhogg welcomes Hraesvelgr, who attempts in vain to persuade his brother from his vengeful course. A mighty clash then ensues between the pair, from which there can be only one victor... The city's defenders watch transfixed as Hraesvelgr tumbles onto the bridge, beaten and bloody, Ishgard's fate seemingly sealed. Triumphant, Nidhogg revels in the moment, only to learn that his fallen sibling has entrusted you with a gift: one half of his power.

With Hraesvelgr's might now commingled with your own, you are become Ishgard's best and last hope of staying the rampaging Nidhogg. Slay the great wyrm's shade, and bring an end to a thousand years of fire and blood!

You have succeeded in subduing Nidhogg's shade. Wrest the wyrm's eyes from Estinien's armor, and rid your companion of Nidhogg's virulent spirit.

Following Alphinaud's lead, you join in the struggle to tear Nidhogg's eyes from Estinien's mail. Using every onze of your strength, you wrestle with the hateful things, arcs of crackling aether enveloping you in agony, but just when the feat appears beyond you, you appear to receive aid from a most unexpected source...

With one final heave, you succeed in separating man and wyrm, and for an instant you glimpse Nidhogg's disembodied spirit, before casting his eyes into the abyss. At long last, it is over. Having done all you can for Estinien, you watch as Ser Aymeric bears him back to Ishgard. Join Alphinaud at the Arc of the Worthy, and discuss the aftermath of the battle.

Upon returning to Ishgard, Alphinaud praises you for your victory over Nidhogg's shade. Whatever joy he feels at the dread wyrm's defeat, however, is overshadowed by his concern for the battered Estinien...

-- Alphinaud seems distracted.

Alphinaud

-- Your battle with Nidhogg's shade will beget many an epic ballad, Luna, and rightly so. It was, without a doubt, one of your more epochal victories─though I must admit that I took greater joy in seeing you emerge from the experience unscathed. ...And not only for your own sake. Had you not been there to aid me, those infernal eyes would still be fused to Estinien's mail... Yet even with Nidhogg gone, I cannot help but wonder how much of our friend remains... Let us pay a visit to Lucia, and beg news of his condition.

-- Let us speak with Lucia. She will know how Estinien fares.

Lucia

-- Luna, Master Alphinaud...my honored friends... As if winning Hraesvelgr to our cause were not enough, you took it upon yourselves to rid us of his brood-brother... I know not how to thank you.

Alphinaud

-- My own contribution was hardly noteworthy. The true saviors of the day were Luna and Estinien. One triumphed over Nidhogg's shade through strength of arms and the other through strength of will.

-- ...And speaking of Estinien, what news of his recovery?

Lucia

-- The Azure Dragoon was conveyed to the infirmary, where he now resides under the care of our hospitalier captain. I am told he has yet to regain consciousness. But as you know, Estinien's mind and body were held hostage for many days. We must be patient, and allow the process of healing to begin. In the meantime, you would do well to rest and recover from your own ordeals.

Alphinaud

-- But surely─

Lucia

-- Ser Aymeric is never long from Estinien's bedside, and will send word the moment there are any developments. Now, if I have satisfied your concerns, I believe Lord Edmont and his sons are most eager to celebrate your return.

Alphinaud

-- ...Very well, First Commander.

-- Come, Luna─'twould seem that we are awaited at Fortemps Manor.

Lucia

-- Pray call upon Lord Edmont. I gather Fortemps Manor holds its breath for your return.

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- The heroes of the hour return!

Alphinaud

-- We but did our duty, my lord. It was the memories of fallen friends and not our heroism which saw us through at the last.

Artoirel

-- I gave every onze of my strength, but mine efforts would have counted for naught had the Warrior of Light not arrived to challenge the great wyrm. As a sworn knight of Ishgard, I had hoped to do more for my city...

Emmanellain

-- Well, we cannot all be heroes, dear brother. Let us put away our pride for a moment, and revel in the valiant deeds of our comrade! For your sterling service to Ishgard, we salute you!

-- And while we're on the subject of valiant deeds, I believe I myself have earned some small measure of recognition: under my watchful command, the ballistas of the outer ward struck down a veritable swarm of Dravanian invaders.

Honoroit

-- My lord's command was certainly watchful. He bravely watched as the siege crews took aim, and continued to watch as countless wyverns met their end. Indeed, the ward's defenders proved so well drilled that my lord had little occasion to stop watching.

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- There will be time enough to determine who is most deserving of recognition later. Our friends are doubtless weary from their exertions. I had chambers prepared in expectation of your return. You are welcome to retire at your leisure.

Alphinaud

-- I am most grateful for your hospitality, my lord, but I believe I shall pay a visit to the Temple Knights' infirmary. Pray excuse me.

Count Edmont de Fortemps

-- How Master Alphinaud has grown. The plight of his stricken brother-in-arms pains him more than his own hurts. ...In which respect, he has come to resemble you, Warrior of Light. Go then─visit the Azure Dragoon, and grant him what comfort you may.

Emmanellain

-- Without the guiding hand of yours truly, House Haillenarte's famous dragonkillers wouldn't have killed half so many dragons just now─as I shall be sure to tell my lady when next we meet...

Honoroit

-- If my lord's irrepressible optimism were ever to fix upon something about which he had cause to be optimistic, I dare not think what he might achieve.

Lucia

-- Estinien is resting in our infirmary. The sickbeds are our front line now, and the battle to save the wounded continues unabated...

Aymeric

-- Luna, my friend. What can I do for the savior of Ishgard? ...You seek Master Alphinaud? Ah. He came to relieve me of my vigil a short while ago. When he begged to sit at Estinien's side, I could not well refuse him. Though he would sooner faint than admit it, the boy must be exhausted by Hraesvelgr's trial and all that followed... Estinien is blessed to have such devoted comrades.

Alphinaud praises you for your epochal victory over Nidhogg, but admits that freeing Estinien felt the greater accomplishment.

Make your way to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly, and inquire with Lucia as to the Azure Dragoon's condition.

After thanking you for your deeds in service to Ishgard, Lucia informs you that Estinien has yet to regain consciousness.

Head to Fortemps Manor with Alphinaud and announce your return to the city.

-- Aymeric appears lost in nostalgia.

Aymeric

-- My own friendship with Estinien began some ten years past, shortly after we joined the Temple Knights... I learned his name soon enough, but Estinien barely registered my existence. I was less a fellow recruit, and more a shadow which occasionally darkened his path. And so I might have remained, had fate not seen fit to intervene. While out on patrol, our company was set upon by a dragon, and we were the only two to survive. The experience forged a bond between us, as such life-threatening situations are wont to do.

-- Despite our friendship, he remained an intense and solitary youth, wholly obsessed with claiming vengeance against Nidhogg. Revenge was ever at the forefront of his mind─revenge for the death of his parents, and revenge for his younger brother. I would venture that in Alphinaud he sees something of his lost sibling. And in the ungentle chidings of Estinien, Alphinaud has found the elder brother he never had.

-- Truth be told, Estinien's tactless observations have saved me from disaster more than once, and I can well understand Alphinaud's affection for him. He is a friend for whom I would gladly─

Temple Herald

-- Lord Commander! Your presence is required in the infirmary!

Aymeric

-- Is he─ Tell them I am on my way!

Lucia

-- <sigh> So it is over, then...

Temple Herald

-- Captain Whitecape ordered me to fetch Ser Aymeric with all haste. I know no more than that.

Handeloup

-- I did not take the Azure Dragoon for a man to pass in his bed...

Aymeric

-- Quickly, Luna! We must go to him!

Alphinaud

-- Oh... Estinien...

Estinien

-- Cease your mewling, boy. It grates my ears.

Alphinaud

-- Forgive me. When I saw you awaken, I could not─ It was such a relief! We feared you might never wake up!

Aymeric

-- Now, now, Estinien. If Master Alphinaud thought any less of you, you would still be Nidhogg's plaything─or dead

Estinien

-- Aye, aye. 'Twas but a jest.

-- I thank you, Alphinaud...and you too, Warrior of Light. Quite how you managed to persuade Hraesvelgr to aid in his brood-brother's downfall, I cannot imagine─but full glad am I that you did. 'Tis an honor to share the mantle of Azure Dragoon with one such as you.

Aymeric

-- I, for my part, owe you an apology. When last we met, I did willingly loose an arrow at your heart. Can you forgive me?

Estinien

-- There is naught to forgive, Aymeric. You but acted in defense of Ishgard, as is your duty. Were you any less single-minded about it, I would not follow you into battle─nor trust you at my back. Besides, I had come to the selfsame conclusion─that I would have to perish for Nidhogg to be stopped. So let us dispense with the hand-wringing. I have heard enough mewling for one day.

Alphinaud

-- Oh!

Estinien

-- The tendrils of Nidhogg's foul presence bound up every fiber of my being, usurping my senses, but I yet retained some trace of awareness. The wyrm's mind was as a vast and tumultuous sea. Endlessly its black waters churned, his grief and despair at Ratatoskr's murder never calming, never receding. And driven by this surging current came wave upon wave of unrelenting rancor.

-- It was the very image of my own heart. There I saw the dark reflection of the hatred I felt after Nidhogg slew my family, when no path remained save vengeance against dragonkind.

-- Neither one of us had a choice. But I was blessed with something Nidhogg was not─comrades and teachers to console and admonish me.

-- Had I not had them to gainsay my obsession, it would surely have consumed me, as Nidhogg's did him, and we would have been in all respects alike.

-- Though his shade is banished, his spirit scattered upon the Sea of Clouds, I feel no joy at his passing. Where once I craved vengeance, I now crave rest.

-- Lord Commander, my hunt is at an end. I would lay down the mantle of Azure Dragoon.

Aymeric

-- My friend...

Hospitalier Captain Abel

-- He has tired himself with too many words. I doubt not that he will make a full recovery, but he must be allowed some few days of quiet.

Aymeric

-- I too must see my path to its end. Sleep well, my friend.

Following the battle with Nidhogg on the Steps of Faith, Ser Aymeric called an assembly that he might make his final proclamation as acting head of state.
'Twas there, with one decree, that the thousand-year rule of the archbishops was ended, paving the way for a new republic.
The governance of Ishgard would now be placed in the hands of high- and lowborn alike, their ranks represented by the newly founded House of Lords and House of Commons.
Church was separated from state. The foundation for change had been carefully laid, and the reforms proposed by Ishgard's new government passed into law without incident.
His duty done, Aymeric de Borel gladly stepped down from the archbishop's dais... only to be raised unto the highest seat in the House of Lords.
Though he strove at first to refuse this honor, the unexpectedly strident voice of the Count de Durendaire left him little choice but to accept...
And so it was that the winds of gentle revolution came to stir.
Prominent among the many honored guests at Ser Aymeric's investiture were the ambassadors of dragonkind, a fitting symbol of Ishgard's newfound peace.
The people looked on in awe as he soared through the heavens on dragonback, and by their cheers did they hail him an Azure Dragoon for a new age.
Thus were the notes of the Dragonsong rewritten, the din of war giving way to a rising litany of peace and hope.

Aymeric

-- I was gazing out at the Sea of Clouds, in an all too rare moment of idleness, when I chanced to behold a certain hero wending her way towards the city on dragonback. Welcome home, Luna.

-- Nay, 'twas no grave matter that moved me to greet you in person. Between you and me, I merely sought respite from the pressures of office... No sooner do I surrender my role as temporary head of state than I am burdened with a position of more permanent responsibility! I fancy that it echoes in some small measure the way you must feel when your improbable feats of heroism are rewarded with still more impossible challenges...

-- The myth which guided our society for generations lies in tatters─am I then to be scorned for building upon the system of nobility that I once sought to tear down? And what strange jest is this that places me at its pinnacle? An archbishop's bastard at the head of the House of Lords...

-- ...Ah, but these questions are for me to answer.

-- It is not in man's nature to change overnight. This I learned through painful experience. And it was this hard lesson which convinced me to take the path which we now follow. Even as we rebuild the bridge between man and dragon, so must we reimagine Ishgard─one carefully placed stone at a time. We must remember that it is not for us that we lay this groundwork, but for the men and women that our children will become. May their towers rise proudly from the fundament of our legacy.

-- ...I hear word from Captain Whitecape that Estinien has vanished from his sickroom. His willfulness survives undiminished. Should you ever happen upon our unmannerly friend on your travels, pray assure him that I shall keep Ishgard safe until he deigns to come home.

-- Thank you, Luna. And please, convey my warmest regards to Master Alphinaud.

Tataru

--You've saved the day again, Luna! ...Not that I ever doubted you would!

Alphinaud

-- You spoke with Ser Aymeric? I do not envy him his new position. Ishgard has chosen a new road, but one littered with the detritus of a thousand years of broken faith. Yet though her people may stumble from time to time, I know of none better than Ser Aymeric to lead the march of progress. As for us, there remains the small matter of ushering in a new dawn in the shadow of inscrutable Ascian machinations and a seemingly endless procession of primals... But we too must walk our chosen path─no matter how treacherous the footing!

System

-- In the wake of Ishgard's governmental reform, new airship routes have been sanctioned. You may now travel to a selection of distant locales from the landing in Ishgard.

Ardbert

-- Thank you, Blanhaerz. Nay, you need not remain there. We shall rendezvous at the usual place.

Elidibus

-- All is proceeding as expected, then?

Ardbert

-- Aye, there is naught to concern us. Aside from one overly curious mouse...

Elidibus

-- It is of no moment. They will play their part, and we will play ours...

-----------------------------------------------

Tataru

-- When the Horde began their assault, I made sure to have my trusty grimoire to hand and incantations at the ready! It had been some time since I last conjured Carbuncle, however, and...well, it's probably best that we not discuss how that ended.

Alphinaud

-- 'Twould seem that our dear friend Estinien has slipped from his sickbed and vanished from the city. Were it anyone else I might expect a word of farewell, but such is not his way. Nevertheless, I shall thoroughly berate him for his lack of manners the next time we meet!

House Fortemps Manservant

-- Now that my lord Artoirel has assumed the mantle of count, the mood of the manor has shifted somewhat. I do not mean for the worse, of course!
Though my lord seeks to succeed his father in word and deed, the demands of a new era necessarily dictate a new direction. And wheresoever the count leads us, the servants of House Fortemps shall follow!

Ser Aymeric relates a small part of his and Estinien's shared history, and muses on the brotherly bond which has formed between Alphinaud and the gruff dragoon. His thoughts are interrupted, however, by the sudden arrival of a messenger who urges the lord commander to visit the infirmary immediately. Trouble Ser Aymeric for news of your ailing comrade's condition.

Having followed Ser Aymeric to the infirmary, you are relieved to find Estinien in full possession of his senses and already mocking the openly weeping Alphinaud. You sense, however, that he is a changed man. Having spoken of his spirit's enslavement by Nidhogg, he declares at last that he intends to surrender the mantle of Azure Dragoon, his hunt now at an end.

Echoing Estinien's resolve, Ser Aymeric finally moves to abolish the thousand-year rule of the archbishops, paving the way for a new republic. In the days that follow, Ishgard's governance is placed in the hands of a newly formed House of Commons and House of Lords. And though Ser Aymeric would like nothing more than to lay down the reins of state, he soon finds himself elected to the highest seat in the latter.

You, meanwhile, borrow Midgardsormr's wings to escort Hraesvelgr back to Zenith, and find the former lord commander waiting to greet you upon your return. Speak with Ser Aymeric at the airship landing.

Ser Aymeric is clearly burdened by his new position, but is quick to stifle his complaints, vowing to lead Ishgard into a new era of peace─one measured step at a time. He then reveals that Estinien has disappeared, and asks that you give him a message should your paths ever chance to cross. Finally, Ser Aymeric bids you convey his warmest regards to Alphinaud. Return to Fortemps Manor, and seek him out.

Alphinaud appears certain that Ser Aymeric will make good on his promise to lead the people of Ishgard safely along their chosen road, though the way be choked with the debris of history. The Scions, too, have a difficult path ahead of them─bringing about a new dawn will be no easy task in the shadow of Ascian plots and implacable primals. But as the final strains of the Dragonsong War drift gently heavensward and a newborn litany of peace swells to take its place, it cannot be denied that there is much to celebrate.
