-- Alphinaud would like very much to continue the search for Thancred.

Alphinaud

-- Well, what are we waiting for? For all we know, Thancred could be waiting for us in Loth ast Vath! We must go and see the Vath right away. Come along, everyone! Come along!

Vath Storyteller

-- <click> <click> Great hunters, we welcome you once more to Loth ast Vath. What do you seek this day?

Alphinaud

-- We seek a man. A man with whom we are told you may have had certain dealings.

Vath Storyteller

-- ...How curious. The hunters tire of godly sport and pursue mortal prey?

Alphinaud

-- No, no, he is not prey, but a friend long missing.

Vath Storyteller

-- <click> <click> Good, good. He is a friend to the Vath as well, one with whom we have traded many times.

Alphinaud

-- Truly? And you are quite certain it was this man?

Vath Storyteller

-- There is no doubt. <click> <click> The fleshling clothed in skins came to us from Sohm Al, lost and weak. He offered meat and hides in trade, and in exchange we tended his wounds. He brought us much flesh, so skilled a hunter he was. Much flesh. When he asked for garments, we were glad to provide them.

Y'shtola

-- And where is he now?

Vath Storyteller

-- <click> <click> Gone to Loth ast Gnath. Not long ago. When he heard the Onemind had summoned our god once more.

Y'shtola

-- Ravana is returned!?

Alphinaud

-- Vidofnir did say that the Gnath had grown as before. But what could Thancred hope to accomplish by himself?

-- Honored elder, we thank you for your help. Would that we could repay this kindness ere we depart, but we must hasten to our comrade's side.

Vath Storyteller

-- Go, great hunters, lest the Gnath claim him as a sacrifice. <click> <click>

-- <click> <click> One hunter, however skilled, cannot stand against the colony. Go to your friend.

Alphinaud

-- Who else could be... Thancred! It could be Thancred! We must hurry!

----------------------------------------

Ardbert

-- This day we reclaim the reins of history! This day we rid ourselves of the Ascians forever!

Ascian

-- Fools playing at heroes, all of you. Is this how you believe you can save your world?

Ardbert

-- We can and will, Ascian! You shall see‚îÄor perhaps you will not!

----------------------------------------

Ardbert

-- So you are the Warrior of Light. The savior of Eorzea. It's a wonder you didn't come sooner, what with the primal and all. Lost a step, have we?

Y'shtola

-- Have care. The aether moves strangely around him.

Alphinaud

-- It would seem we share a common enemy. Mayhap you would tell us who you are?

Ardbert

-- ...Shall we show them?

----------------------------------------

Ardbert

-- Not very sporting of you to interrupt, but so be it. Mark well our faces, Warrior of Light, for we are the Warriors of Darkness. Walkers of a different path. And we shall meet again.

Krile

-- Warriors of Darkness? ...Really?

Alphinaud

-- Thancred! Are you all right?

Thancred

-- Pleasantries can wait. I'd rather not be here when the Gnath arrive. Agreed?

-- The vision caught me unawares, and I was unprepared for their attack, but...I could hear the colony chattering all around us... They were so loud...so unbearably loud...

Alphinaud

Y'shtola

Y'shtola

-- Suffice it to say, our reunion was not at all as I pictured it. Waiting until the last instant to join the fray. 'Tis plain you have not lost your appetite for the dramatic.

Thancred

-- My appetite for the dramatic!? Have you forgotten the circumstances of our parting? The heroic last stand, the tunnel filling with light, and then... <sigh> Had I known you intended to use forbidden magicks to deliver me to some godsforsaken wilderness... ...I would have thanked you in advance.

Y'shtola

-- Thancred...

Thancred

-- If nothing else, you might have warned me that I would emerge from the Lifestream in the altogether. Eventually, I managed to fashion knives from some obsidian I found, and set about hunting for meat and hides. Given that I'm not all that skilled in leatherworking, it's probably for the best that I met the Vath before I was reunited with you.

Alphinaud

-- So you were the ‚Äúfleshling clothed in skins‚Äù of whom the storyteller spoke.

Thancred

-- A description which fit me as ill as the skins themselves. Happily, I was able to trade with the Vath for garments better becoming a man of refinement. From them I learned of Ravana, and of the great warrior who had once laid him low.

Y'shtola

-- And thence did you conclude that were you to track the primal's movements, it would surely bring you into contact with the Scions once more.

Thancred

-- It seemed a reasonable assumption. I could think of no one else with your enthusiasm for slaying beastman gods. Until now, that is.

Alphinaud

-- Ah yes...the self-proclaimed ‚ÄúWarriors of Darkness.‚Äù 'Tis only fitting that they stand in opposition to the Warrior of Light, I suppose.

Krile

-- I glimpsed the leader's past‚îÄif only for a moment. They were confronting a man in black. An Ascian, I think.

Alphinaud

-- If these warriors are capable of doing battle with Ascians and primals both, they must be possessed of powerful protection‚îÄprotection not unlike the Echo...

Thancred

-- I know what you're thinking, but really, you needn't worry. It will only lend credence to my tales of heroism. Besides, battle scars are to maidens what loose morals are to gentlemen. A definite bonus.

Y'shtola

-- 'Twould seem the mystery of the axe-wielding Hyur has been laid to rest. I should have known better than to think Thancred would ever stoop to using such an inelegant weapon... But then how was I to know there was not one vagabond wandering the Chocobo Forest but two.

At Alphinaud's impassioned urging, you set out for Loth ast Vath to continue the search. Speak with the Vath storyteller and see if he recognizes Thancred from the sketch.

Though wary at first, the storyteller soon confirms that the Vath have indeed had dealings with Thancred. The ‚Äúfleshling clothed in skins,‚Äù as they call him, came to them from Sohm Al weak and disoriented, and was given succor in exchange for meat and hides. According to the storyteller, he stayed with them for some time, but left recently, after learning that the Gnath had summoned forth Ravana from the aether once more--news which comes as a shock to your allies, but does much to explain the beastmen's recent aggression towards Anyx Trine. Fearing what may happen if Thancred is forced to face the Gnath alone, you resolve to find him before they do. Clear a path to Loth ast Gnath that your allies might follow.

You quickly dispatch the sentries stationed outside the stronghold's entrance. All that remains is to wait for the others to arrive.

Moments after being rejoined by your comrades, you hear the unmistakable sounds of battle coming from deep within the Gnath stronghold. Fearing that Thancred may be in danger, you rush towards the source of the cacophony, only to be confronted with an unexpected sight: a party of adventurers locked in combat with the Lord of the Hive, and having seized the upper hand no less. As you look on in silence, their leader cuts down the Gnath god in a display of power far beyond that of any common adventurer. An equal, perhaps? ...Or a rival? Cautiously, you and your allies approach the strangers, and as you lock eyes with their leader, you find yourself overcome with a vision of his past.

You see him and his comrades stand against an Ascian, just as you once stood against Lahabrea, and watch as they forge a blade to strike him down. A blade not unlike your own blade of Light.

‚ÄúSo you are the Warrior of Light. The savior of Eorzea.‚Äù Your counterpart regards you coldly, his every word dripping with disdain. A rival, then. Seeking to defuse the tension, Alphinaud warily requests an introduction, only to be greeted with a sudden display of force which scatters your allies, leaving you to face the leader alone. Grimly, you draw your weapon and prepare to meet his attack in kind, when suddenly, from on high, Thancred descends to duel with the warrior. After finding themselves to be evenly matched, the stranger withdraws, but not before declaring that he and his comrades are the Warriors of Darkness‚îÄand that you shall meet again.

After escaping the Gnath stronghold, Thancred explains how he survived in the wilderness before making contact with the Vath, who furnished him with his new garments, and told him of Ravana, whom he was certain you would be drawn to face. However, he did not account for the intervention of the self-proclaimed Warriors of Darkness, who clearly harbor ill will towards you and yours. Yet how could they best primals and Ascians both if not through the power of the Echo? And if they are indeed blessed as you and Krile are, what would drive them to stand in apparent opposition to your cause?

# Dreams of the Lostüéß

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Alphinaud is lost in thought, doubtless ruminating on the implications of your encounter with the Warriors of Darkness.

Alphinaud

-- Blessed with the power of the Echo, and driven to put down primals... Despite his declaration that they walk a different path, I struggle to see how their goals conflict with ours. Nor is that the only oddity. I find it passing strange that such exceptional individuals should have wholly escaped our notice until now. Surely we would have heard rumors and attempted to recruit them to our cause?

Y'shtola

-- I recall no such adventurers‚îÄand I would not soon forget their like. Nor would any of us, I think. One of our primary duties was to scour the city-states for promising candidates‚îÄwhich is how Yda and Papalymo found Luna.

Thancred

-- Ah, the memories. It seems like only yesterday that you slew your first primal. Speaking of which, I had the distinct impression that it was not the first time that band of merry men and women had killed a god.

Y'shtola

-- I labor to believe that a band of preternaturally gifted adventurers has been traveling the land, slaying primals without our knowledge. 'Twould imply gross negligence on our part.

Alphinaud

-- Speculation will avail us naught. There is far too much we do not know. For the present, we must needs concentrate on what we do know, namely that Lord Ravana is no more. Vidofnir must be informed. The news may render her more receptive to Ser Aymeric's invitation.

Krile

-- Since you seem to have affairs here well in hand, I shall take my leave. Simply being in the vicinity of this colony is giving me a stinking headache. If you have need of me, I shall be with Master Matoya. I would beg her assistance with the search for Minfilia.

Thancred

-- Wait‚îÄMinfilia is missing? I thought she escaped with Luna.

Alphinaud

-- I shall explain on the road. Much has happened in your absence...

Vidofnir

-- I had not thought to see thee again so soon, mortal. If thou seekest the knight, know that she hath long since departed for Ishgard.

Alphinaud

-- My thanks, Vidofnir, but it was not for her that we came. We bring good tidings for you and yours. Lord Ravana, who had been summoned by the Gnath, has again been laid low.

Vidofnir

-- Truly? Once more you mortals have succeeded where mine own kind did fail. You have our deepest thanks.

Alphinaud

-- Would that we could take credit. The god fell by another's hand.

Vidofnir

-- Another? Revelation upon revelation. Regardless, it is cause for celebration. The Gnath will have no choice but to withdraw.

-- But to another matter. I have tidings for thee as well.

Alphinaud

-- Regarding the Ishgardians' invitation?

Vidofnir

-- As promised, I brought the matter to my sire. Hearken to his answer now.

-- ‚ÄúFor a thousand years have I mourned my beloved, who gave her life to forge a peace thy king betrayed. Such was my lot, until a child of Ishgard came unto me. For want of warmth, she wrapped herself in a dream. Yet the world will remember her deeds. For truth, she fought. For justice, she sinned. For redemption, she sacrificed, and became as light. To follow one's heart, to have faith in one's convictions--be it for weal, or be it for woe. Such is the folly and the glory of man...and of dragon.‚Äù

-- He hath entrusted the choice to us, and we have made it. We will keep faith with you who walk in the Light.

-- When Ysayle first brought thee before me, I knew in my heart of hearts that this day would come.

Alphinaud

-- Then you accept Ser Aymeric's invitation?

Vidofnir

-- Let it be known that I, Vidofnir, shall journey unto Ishgard on behalf of my people.

Alphinaud

-- We are honored to receive your answer, and will convey your words to our allies without delay.

-- It is happening, Ysayle. Would that you were here to see it...

Y'shtola

-- Fortunately, the journey afforded us ample time to brief Thancred on recent events.

Thancred

-- So you slew a handful of primals, chatted with the Emperor of Garlemald, uncovered the truth behind a thousand-year war, thwarted a megalomaniacal archbishop's ambitions, and then rode home on the back of the Father of Dragons. Does that about sum it up?

Alphinaud

-- Right. Let us not keep Ser Aymeric waiting.

-- ...Are you quite well, Thancred?

Thancred

-- Yes‚îÄyes, quite well. Forgive me. You have given me rather a lot to digest. This whole affair with the Ishgardians and the Dravanians...and our friends nowhere to be found. 'Twould seem there is no end to our troubles.

Y'shtola

-- We can but face them head-on, one at a time. For now, we must apply ourselves to our allotted tasks and leave the others to theirs. Remember, Thancred‚îÄwe found you, as they found me. In time, we will find Yda and Papalymo and Minfilia as well. These troubles will soon be but a memory‚îÄone which we will look back on together.

Thancred

-- Pray do not misunderstand‚îÄI did not mean to imply that it would be otherwise. I merely wish that I had rejoined our grand adventure at one of its more triumphal moments. Despite your recent accomplishments, the mood here is less than celebratory. But I have no doubt that we will enjoy many more glorious victories soon enough‚îÄand you may rest assured that I will play my part in them to the very hilt.

Alphinaud

-- I know you will. So then‚îÄto the Congregation!

Tataru

-- We can celebrate Thancred's return later. You and Alphinaud are needed at the Congregation!

Hilda

-- Oh good, you're back. Things got a bit heated while you were away.

Handeloup

-- This is a dark day for the Temple Knights. But I have faith that we shall overcome this trial.

Gibrillont

-- The city's gone mad, Luna. Steer clear of the Brume if you don't want to get burned.

Lucia

-- You have returned! In this at least the fates are kind.

Alphinaud

-- Greetings, First Commander! It pleases me to inform you that Vidofnir has accepted Ser Aymeric's invitation.

Lucia

-- She has!? These are glad tidings indeed... Would that the lord commander were here to hear them.

Alphinaud

-- Ah. Is he otherwise engaged?

Hilda

-- Aye‚îÄsleepin' off a knife to the gut.

Alphinaud

-- What? What happened!? Will he live?

Lucia

-- The chirurgeons tell me he will make a full recovery. But had Lord Edmont and Lord Artoirel not been on hand when the assassin struck, he would not have been so fortunate. For a mercy, they subdued the fiend before he could land the telling blow.

Hilda

-- The attack was just the beginnin', though. Not long after, buildings all 'round the city‚îÄincludin' several of ours‚îÄburst into flame. Bastards caught us completely by surprise. We've been dowsin' the fires, but for every one we put out, it seems like two more start up. Casualties are mountin'‚îÄespecially in the Brume.

Lucia

-- 'Tis plain these fires were started by the assassin's conspirators. Until they have been rounded up, there will be no end to this. Will you help us find them? Then let us be about it.

Hilda

-- Even if we had the same resources to combat the fires as them up in the Pillars, we'd still be fightin' a losin' battle. You've seen the Brume‚îÄall them narrow streets with wooden houses crammed together. It's kindlin' is what it is.

Alphinaud

-- Just as Ser Aymeric risked his life to bring about lasting change, so too will others wager all to preserve what they hold dear.

Y'shtola

-- The archbishop may have fallen, but the legacy of his predecessors endures.

Thancred

-- Louisoix once told me that man is all too willing to let his future be bound by his past. And time after time have I witnessed how depressingly right he was.

Given the relative ease with which they dispatched Ravana, it seems all but certain that the Warriors of Darkness have fought such beings before. Yet how could such exceptionally gifted individuals have escaped the notice of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, when one of the order's founding goals was to identify and recruit adventurers blessed with the power of the Echo? Though their appearance raises many questions, their deeds cannot be denied. The Lord of the Hive is no more, and Vidofnir must be told.

Though surprised that he did not fall by your hand, Vidofnir is nevertheless pleased to learn of Ravana's defeat. Moreover, having received your good tidings, she offers some of her own: Hraesvelgr has entrusted her with deciding whether or not to accept Ser Aymeric's invitation. The great white dragon duly states that she will keep faith in you and journey to Ishgard. Elated by her reply, Alphinaud announces that he will convey her words to the lord commander at once. The time has come to return to the capital.

During the long journey back to Ishgard, you and the others share the many trials and tribulations of recent days with a rapt Thancred. Though glad to hear of your many successes, he is saddened to learn that Yda, Papalymo, and Minfilia are still missing. Seeing this, Y'shtola assures him that one day these troubles will be a distant memory‚îÄa future which Thancred pledges to do his utmost to help bring about.

Lucia receives the news of Vidofnir's acceptance with a mixture of happiness and regret, for Ser Aymeric is not present to hear it, having been wounded in an attempted assassination. Though he is like to make a full recovery, the attack was only the beginning; shortly thereafter, buildings throughout the city burst into flame, as part of what appears to be a coordinated‚îÄand ongoing‚îÄattack. As fast as the old fires are quenched, new ones are set. If the perpetrators are not brought to justice, there is no telling when the chaos will end.

# Against the Dying of the Light

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Lucia would begin the hunt for the arsonists without delay.

Tataru

-- At first I thought it was just a horrible tragedy, but now they're saying it was arson? what kind of person would do such a thing...

Lucia

-- The flames are spreading. We must needs begin our investigation immediately. Witnesses must be found; suspects must be identified.

Alphinaud

-- Have you been able to determine the precise locations where the fires were set? Mayhap there is a pattern.

Lucia

-- If there is, we have yet to discern it. Fires have been reported throughout the city, in both the Pillars and Foundation. Indeed, given the size of the area affected, I think it best to divide our forces. Master Alphinaud and Mistress Y'shtola‚îÄI would have you take charge of the investigation in Foundation.

Alphinaud

-- As you wish. Mayhap Tataru can be of assistance as well.

Hilda

-- Meanin' Luna and me get the Pillars. Oh, they'll like me up there. Only question is, will the grizzled old rogue strikin' a pose over there be joinin' us?

Thancred

-- Thancred, of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. And may I say what a pleasure it is to meet you too, my lady.

Hilda

-- I'll bet. The name's Hilda. A Scion, eh? And there I was thinkin' I'd found a fellow ruffian amongst all these illustrious personages.

Lucia

-- I will remain here to coordinate the fire-quenching effort. If you learn aught of value, pray inform me immediately. That is all.

Thancred

-- While we could begin by sifting through charred rubble and questioning random passersby, in my experience, every town has at least one individual who can be counted on to know things he or she should not.

Hilda

-- Oh, aye...the infamous Lord Emmanellain de Fortemps, lover of women and wine‚îÄthough neither care for him that much. They say he could gossip for Ishgard.

Thancred

-- Just the sort of fellow I had in mind. Capital suggestion, Luna.

Hilda

-- He'll be at the Crozier most like, makin' an effort to be seen. So let's go and see him.

Thancred

-- ...Grizzled I will accept, but old? <sigh>

Hilda

-- Well, go on then. Talk to the daft sod.

Thancred

-- Someone once said that a gentleman is rather than does. And in Lord Emmanellain I sense we have living proof.

Honoroit

-- (Ah, Mistress Kali. I fear Lord Emmanellain has once more strayed from the path. As has so often been the case, his renewed enthusiasm for martial training gave way to frustration and disinterest at the first sign of difficulty...)

Emmanellain

-- Well, well, if it isn't Luna, dearest of all my friends! You're looking rather glum. Something the matter, old girl?

-- Ah, yes, the arsons. Dreadful business, that‚îÄand awfully curious, wouldn't you say? There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it at all. Naturally, we've doubled the guard outside the manor, along with most of the other houses. Can't have the old pile going up in flames, after all! Oh, in case you were wondering why the Hoplon is awash with refugees, the lower levels of the Vault have been opened to those unfortunate souls who have lost their homes. Ser Aymeric's orders, from what I hear. Remarkable man‚îÄnot even a knife in the ribs can keep him from his duties! Actually, old girl...if you were thinking of questioning the refugees, I should be more than happy to accompany you to the Hoplon. While you conduct your inquiries, I could offer words of comfort to the distressed and despondent young maidens...?

-- Wait a moment...I know what that is. You're giving me one of your looks, aren't you? You do me an injustice, old girl! I will have you know, my heart yearns for but one rose‚îÄprickly though she may be! ...I sense you remain unconvinced. Very well, if it will help to prove the purity of my intentions, I shall gracefully rescind my offer. Now run along and catch those arsonists!

Thancred

-- That was...not entirely what I had hoped for. Whose idea was it to come here again? Never mind. For our next step, I suggest we divide our efforts. While you question the refugees in the Hoplon, Luna, I shall investigate the locations where the fires were set. Would you be so good as to join me, Hilda?

Hilda

-- You know what, I reckon I would. Can't have you roamin' about in an unfamiliar city by your lonesome, can we? You'd only get robbed blind and left shiverin' in your smallclothes.

Honoroit

-- My lord is a gentleman of unassailable principles. To assail them, after all, one would first need to locate them.

Emmanellain

-- I shall detain you no longer, old girl. Good luck with your investigation!

Lucia

-- I have faith that Ser Aymeric will soon return to assume command. And when he does, I would welcome him with a gift‚îÄour arsonists, bound and begging for mercy.

Tataru

-- You didn't expect me to stand idly by when there was work to be done, did you?

Y'shtola

-- Wooden dwellings built end-to-end and one atop another, each home to a family... How many were abed when the fires were set...?

Alphinaud

-- Prior to the fire, do you perchance recall anyone unfamiliar loitering in the vicinity?

Maelie

-- What did we do to deserve this?

-- There was a man with a satchel. I saw him kneelin' outside the window, and then there was smoke everywhere, and it was so hot, and I couldn't breathe... I don't remember how I made it out. I s'pose I must have climbed... Maybe my arm is gettin' better after all?

-- Why did he do it? What did we ever do to him?

Unruffled Refugee

-- I cannot well abandon my parents! But milord will not accept all three of us into his service. What am I to do?

-- Ours was one of the first homes to be claimed, but I didn't see how the fire began. It was only when I heard our neighbors shouting that I looked outside and saw the flames. We barely escaped with the clothes on our backs. Were it not for the church's generosity, I don't know what we'd do.

-- Say what you will about the archbishop, but I'll not hear a word spoken against the clergy.

Ballon (Old Lady)

-- Pull yourself together! We'll find a way! We always do!

Ballon (Old Man)

-- I... I just don't...

Vault Priest

-- Have faith, my brothers and sisters, have faith! Halone has not forsaken you! We have not forsaken you!

-- Come, my brothers and sisters! There is food and shelter enough for all in the basilica!

Ragged Refugee

-- Halone's blessings be upon you, Father. I confess, we were not sure if we should come. There are so many unbelievable tales these days‚îÄabout the archbishop, and Ser Aymeric, and the Dravanians...

Vault Priest

-- Trust in your heart, brother, and pay no heed to the lies of lesser men. They seek only to lead you astray.

-- Do you require succor as well, miss?

-- So the Temple Knights have begun their investigation at last! Good. This madness has gone on far too long. Would that I could do something to aid you in your search, but I have a duty to these poor souls. Farewell, and may the Fury guide your steps.

Hilda

-- Finished, then?

Thancred

-- Ah, there you are. Anything to share? Hmph. We will require more than the muddled testimony of a traumatized girl if we are to identify the culprits... While you were questioning the refugees, we inspected the scenes of several of the fires, including one near Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral and another near the Tribunal. For a mercy, neither structure suffered significant damage. Some might say they were spared by the grace of the Fury. Others might question how such ruthlessly efficient arsonists contrived to fail so miserably on the two occasions when their target was a bastion of Ishgardian orthodoxy. Nothing conclusive, of course, but it does give one cause to wonder. Alphinaud will doubtless have an opinion.

Tataru

-- You should've seen the way Alphinaud tackled him!

Captive

-- ....

Y'shtola

-- Good. Now that you are here, we can proceed with the interrogation.

Alphinaud

-- Silence will avail you naught, sir.

-- Ah, Luna! I was just about to summon you. As you can see, we have detained a suspect.

Y'shtola

-- We found this man loitering near the remains of one of the stricken buildings. According to eyewitnesses, he was also present before the fires broke out. We wished to have words; he did not. So we insisted.

Captive

-- Let me go, damn it! You've got the wrong man!

Thancred

-- <sniff> <sniff> My, but you reek of oil. And are those burns on your hands? An occupational hazard, I suppose. But tell me‚îÄdoes arson pay well?

Captive

-- I-I'm a victim, you imbecile! Look at me!

Thancred

-- Aye, that you are‚îÄafter a fashion. You should know that your pious patron has already spun us a delightful yarn about how his pet mongrel slipped the leash and set about burning half the city to the ground. Not very noble of him, I grant you‚îÄbut then these highborn types rarely do show loyalty to their pets. ...In fact, he called you rabid and begged us to put you down.

Captive

-- Th-That's bollocks! He's the one what told me to keep goin'!

-- ...Even a sinner such as me could find salvation in the Fury's work, he said. I'd left it behind‚îÄtried to, with all my heart! Said my prayers every day, like a good man. But he came to me! He came to me!

Thancred

-- And there you have it. Hilda, would you be so kind as to escort our friend here to the Congregation?

Hilda

-- Aye. So long as you don't mind if he's limpin' when he gets there.

Tataru

-- That was incredible, Thancred! But how did you know he would confess?

Thancred

-- Well, I have seen his like before. A troubled soul, manipulated by men of power and wielded as a weapon... I could not be certain, of course. But given the stakes, I thought it worth the risk.

Y'shtola

-- And if our captive had called your bluff?

Thancred

-- Must we entertain hypotheticals? The world as it is is vexing enough.

Alphinaud

-- Thank you, Thancred. Whether by luck or judgment, we have at last confirmed that these arsons were orchestrated by a person or persons of influence. I think it best that we now return to the Congregation and discuss how best to proceed.

Tataru

-- Thank the Twelve you've returned to us! But what happened to your old outfit?

Thancred

-- Ah, yes, about that...

Hilda

-- Bit of a gambler, ain't he? Fine by me, so long as his luck don't run out.

Alphinaud

-- If we could but determine the motive behind these fires...

Y'shtola

-- The Temple Knights are interrogating the arsonist as we speak. Gods willing, we shall have more information ere long.

Handeloup

-- Apologies, Luna, but the interrogation is ongoing.

Lucia

-- On behalf of the Holy See of Ishgard, I thank you all. The man you apprehended is being interrogated as we speak. Though he fell silent upon realizing that we had not turned his master, he will soon tell us what he knows, one way or another.

Artoirel

-- Pardon the intrusion, First Commander...

Lucia

-- Ah, Lord Artoirel. Are you come to see your father? He is attending Ser Aymeric in his chambers at present.

Artoirel

-- I am. He bid me bring this salve.

Lucia

-- Then do not let me detain you. And thank you for your kindness, my lord.

Artoirel

-- In times of trouble, every man must do his part. Would that I could do more.

Alphinaud

-- ...My lord Artoirel did not seem to be in the best of spirits.

Lucia

-- 'Tis little wonder, Master Alphinaud. His father is widely slandered, and his half-brother not yet cold in the grave.

Hilda

-- The past belongs to the dead. The future's ours to do with what we will.

Alphinaud

-- It was not so long ago, was it...

Y'shtola

-- How desperately we cling to that which we hold dear, knowing all the while that a day will come when we must let go.

Thancred

-- No more farewells. Not for a good while yet, at least.

In order to cover more ground, you and your comrades will divide into two parties and investigate the fires separately. Alphinaud, Y'shtola, and Tataru will focus their efforts on Foundation and the Brume, while you, Thancred, and Hilda will begin by questioning the residents of the Pillars‚îÄstarting with one Lord Emmanellain de Fortemps, who is a notorious gossip.

Alas, Lord Emmanellain has little to offer beyond charming repartee, and the observation that the Hoplon has been inundated with refugees on their way to receive food and shelter in the Vault‚îÄan initiative of Ser Aymeric's, apparently. No closer to identifying the arsonists, Thancred and Hilda resolve to inspect the locations where the fires were set while you question the refugees on the off chance that one knows something of value.

Yet again, your efforts avail you little, for while one child thinks she may have caught a glimpse of a suspicious man, she cannot describe him in any detail. Rendezvous with Thancred and Hilda and share your findings, if such they may be called.

Although Thancred has nothing conclusive to add, he does observe that the fires set near Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral and the Tribunal suffered surprisingly minor damage when compared to other less venerated structures. Mayhap Alphinaud's party can contribute more to the investigation.

It would seem that the efforts of your comrades in Foundation have been rather more fruitful, as they have detained a suspect seen loitering near several homes before they were set alight, and more recently near their smoldering remains. Unconvinced by his protestations of innocence, Thancred tricks the man into confessing by claiming his highborn master betrayed his trust. Return to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly and share your findings with Lucia.

Having returned to the Congregation, you breathlessly share the findings of your investigation. Though the arsonist withdrew his cooperation scant moments after providing it, Lucia is confident that she will soon have answers. Your conversation is then interrupted by Lord Artoirel, who has come on his father's behalf to deliver a special salve for Ser Aymeric. As Alphinaud watches him leave, he observes that the young nobleman is not in the best of spirits. To this, Lucia responds that given the rumors circulating about his father and the untimely passing of his half-brother, it would be strange if he were otherwise. Truly, none can deny that House Fortemps has known much tragedy of late...
