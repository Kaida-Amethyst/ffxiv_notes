# The Man Within🎧

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- The House Fortemps knight has a message for you.

House Fortemps Knight

-- Ah, Mistress Kali! It is well that you are here. You are wanted within. I believe Master Alphinaud wishes a word with you...

-- Master Alphinaud awaits within the manor. He appeared quite anxious to speak with you.

Alphinaud

-- Ah, Luna, there you are. Have you a moment? There is something I would fain discuss. I must ask you to recall the events which unfolded at the peace conference, though I daresay you would sooner forget them. My mind returns again and again to the moment when Nidhogg appeared before the crowd in the guise of Estinien. It was a sight to chill the soul─but one which gave me reason to hope that our friend might not be beyond salvation. When you described his fateful transformation at Azys Lla, I feared him lost forever, but the mere fact that some semblance of his former self endures must surely count for something. Alas, I have no evidence to support this impression... Thus did I turn to Y'shtola and Krile for a more empirical appraisal─and full glad am I that I did, for it would seem they have some observations of their own to share.

Tataru

-- The ladies have saved us a table at the Forgotten Knight. Shall we go?

Alphinaud

-- Excellent. Let us not keep our honored colleagues waiting.

Y'shtola

-- The name does this establishment a disservice. Remarkably few of its patrons seem inclined to drink their way to oblivion. I do begin to see why Tataru chose to work here.

Alphinaud

-- We have kept you waiting overlong, I fear...

Krile

-- Not to worry, Alphinaud. We had some rather fine mulled wine to keep us company. Truth be told, you could have delayed your arrival a few moments more...

Tataru

-- Gibrillont got the spicing just right this time. His latest batch is not only delicious and warming, but soothing to the humours.

Y'shtola

-- Indeed. But 'twas not to soothe our humours that we gathered here.

Krile

-- Ah, no─quite right. The matter of that poor dragoon...

Alphinaud

-- You have discovered something─a means to save him?

Krile

-- Let us not jump to conclusions, shall we? Assess the facts presented, then make an educated analysis, as you were taught.

Y'shtola

-- Pray cast your mind back to the moment of Estinien's transformation. Do you recall how you described it to us? You spoke of the sudden pangs which racked his body when he took up both of Nidhogg's eyes─and of how his form was twisted thereafter into a shadowy semblance of the great wyrm.

Alphinaud

-- When he appeared at Falcon's Nest, the wyrm's eyes were fused to his mail.

Y'shtola

-- Would that only his armor had been corrupted... Snaking forth from the eyes, I descried dark tendrils which entangled his very being. His aether has been all but smothered.

Alphinaud

-- Then he is lost to us forever?

Krile

-- What did I just say about jumping to conclusions!? Y'shtola clearly stated “all but smothered.” As I later discovered, her impression matched my own. Though Nidhogg's presence filled my mind's eye, beneath his seething aura, I sensed the merest hint of something else. And after listening to Y'shtola's observations, I became more certain of my suspicion: that the “something else” I had sensed was, in fact, the trace of a different will, submerged in the sea of Nidhogg's rage.

Alphinaud

-- You mean...

Y'shtola

-- Yes. 'Tis like that Estinien's spirit yet lingers.

Alphinaud

-- Can we not wrest him from Nidhogg's grasp, then!? Tear the eyes from the armor!?

Y'shtola

-- We know not if that would serve to separate wyrm's soul from man's. None have ever attempted such a feat.

Alphinaud

-- Should it offer even the faintest hope of success, then by the gods, I shall be the first to try.

Krile

-- Alphinaud... By all means, hold fast to your hope. But be mindful of the dangers. Even should you succeed in excising the eyes from the dragoon's mail, we have no way of knowing if your friend's soul would survive so violent a separation. And that is to say nothing of the possibility that his would-be savior might become Nidhogg's next host.

Alphinaud

-- But what other choice remains to us? Should the opportunity present itself, I will tear those foul orbs from Estinien's armor and trust in the resilience of his soul─even at the risk of mine own!

Honoroit

-- Ah! I've found you at last!

-- A messenger of the Temple Knights came to the manor some few hours past. The lord commander humbly requests the company of the Warrior of Light and Master Alphinaud.

Alphinaud

-- Ser Aymeric would speak with us? Very well. Thank you, Honoroit.

Y'shtola

-- 'Twould seem duty calls. Pray see to yours, and we shall return to ours.

Alphinaud

-- Thank you, Y'shtola, Krile. Your words have given me hope where there was none.

-- Come then. Ser Aymeric awaits.

Krile

-- Alphinaud is allowing his feelings for this dragoon to cloud his thoughts. I worry he may do something rash. Keep an eye on him, would you?

Midgardsormr

-- They think more of their friend's deliverance than their foe's defeat... But will history commend their fealty or condemn their folly?

<div class="border p-6">
The conference held at Falcon's Nest was to be a celebration of the reconciliation 'twixt man and dragon.
But the lingering shade of Nidhogg, clad in the flesh of the Azure Dragoon, did mark the occasion by spilling the blood of his own kind.
A timely atrocity to remind the children of Ishgard that the Dragonsong War was far from over...
And when fear gave way to fury, the call to arms rang out anew: “Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!”

<div class="border p-6">
Tataru

-- I think I'll stay here at the Knight for the time being. After all, the rumors are fresh and the extra coin is always welcome!

Honoroit

-- Have you visited the lord commander, Mistress Kali? Then might I encourage you to report to the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly at your earliest convenience? I would not have it said that I failed to pass on Ser Aymeric's summons.

Alphinaud

-- What news has Ser Aymeric to share with us, I wonder...?

<div class="border p-6">
According to the knight, Alphinaud wishes to speak with you. Enter Fortemps Manor and find out what young Master Leveilleur has to say.

Alphinaud bids you recall the events which unfolded at the peace conference─specifically, the moment when Nidhogg appeared in the guise of Estinien. Believing that the preservation of your friend's corporeal form may offer hope for the dragoon's salvation, he has sought the opinion of Y'shtola and Krile. In response to his request, it appears that they have already journeyed to Ishgard to share their observations. Make your way to the Forgotten Knight and speak with Krile.

At the tavern, Y'shtola and Krile relate their experiences at the conference, concluding at last that Estinien's spirit may indeed have survived, having apparently been enveloped but not consumed by Nidhogg's vengeful will. Heartened, Alphinaud speculates that removing the great wyrm's eyes from the dragoon's armor could potentially free him. Waving away Krile's concerns regarding this dubious proposition, the young Scion declares that he will do whatever it takes to save his friend. In the wake of this impassioned oath, Honoroit appears and announces that Ser Aymeric has requested your presence. Rendezvous with Alphinaud at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly in readiness for your audience.

You join Alphinaud outside the Seat of the Lord Commander. Alphinaud's musings echo your own as you ponder the reason behind Ser Aymeric's summons...

# An Ally for Ishgard🎧

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- Alphinaud is eager to hear what tidings Ser Aymeric has to share.

Alphinaud

-- Hmmm... Might Ser Aymeric perchance have received word of a Dravanian advance? ...Or mayhap they have located Esti─ That is to say, mayhap Nidhogg has been found! Come! I would hear what the lord commander has to say!
</div>

‍

<div class="border p-6">
Aymeric

-- My friends, I thank you for coming.

Alphinaud

-- You have had news of Nidhogg?

Aymeric

-- Alas, not. Our scouts range far and wide, but they have as yet found no trace of the great wyrm.

Lucia

-- We dispatched an elite unit of dragoons to reconnoiter the Churning Mists, but even they returned empty-handed.

Alphinaud

-- A pity...

Aymeric

-- Fear not, Alphinaud--we shall see the wyrm again soon enough. His words at Falcon's Nest attest to that. Indeed, he is like to come sooner than we would wish.

Alphinaud

-- I assume Ishgard's defenses are being bolstered as we speak?

Aymeric

-- With all haste. I mean to call upon every able-bodied warrior at our disposal, from the knights of the four houses to the men and women of the watch. But I did not summon you to discuss strategy.

Alphinaud

-- What then would you have of us, my lord?

Aymeric

-- I will speak plain: now that Nidhogg is possessed of both of his eyes, no mortal force we can muster will repel him. That being the case, we must needs recruit an ally of equal strength...

Alphinaud

-- You speak of Hraesvelgr!?

Aymeric

-- I do. To whom else could we turn?

Alphinaud

-- That he is Nidhogg's equal I do not deny. Nor can I name another. But convincing the reclusive creature to do battle with his own brood-brother will be... How shall I put this?

Aymeric

-- It will be no small undertaking, yes. Estinien's report was most particular about Hraesvelgr's unwillingness to involve himself in the affairs of men. But much has changed since your visit to Sohm Al, and if there is even a chance that the dragon may be swayed, I must plead our case. Whatever price the dragon asks of me, I shall pay it--such was my oath to defend the people of Ishgard.

-- Come what may, my friends, the battle with Nidhogg will mark the end of my tenure as the acting head of church and state. Will you help me discharge this final duty?

Alphinaud

-- We will, my lord─though I fear our involvement offers no guarantee of success. Come, then─we will depart at your leisure.

Aymeric

-- Thank you. Both of you.

-- The city is yours, First Commander.

Lucia

-- 	My lord. We shall pray for your swift return.

Alphinaud

-- I somehow doubt that Hraesvelgr will be pleased to see us. But for Estinien's sake, and that of countless others, I suppose we must risk his displeasure.

Aymeric

-- It grieves me to impose upon you in this manner, but you of all people understand the threat we now face.

Alphinaud

-- It is no imposition, Ser Aymeric─to luna and I, Ishgard is as a second home. After the many battles we have fought and the bonds we have forged, the plight of your nation has become our own. If there is aught that we can do to aid in its salvation, then pray impose all you must.

Aymeric

-- You are true friends...

Alphinaud

-- Shall we be about our task, then? We have no way of knowing when Nidhogg's shade will strike, but we must assume that time is not our ally.

Aymeric

-- Indeed. With that in mind, I have taken the liberty of dispatching a messenger to inform Mistress Tataru that you will be escorting me to Sohm Al. I confess, I did not provide the exact details of our destination, as they are as yet unknown to me...

Alphinaud

-- We will summon Hraesvelgr at Zenith in the Churning Mists. Ere we begin our ascent, however, I think it best that we pay a visit to Anyx Trine.

Aymeric

-- You seek an advantage in the coming negotiations?

Alphinaud

-- I do. I would consult with Vidofnir. I propose this in part out of concern for her condition. Were she to succumb to her wounds, it could have grave consequences for our alliance. That apart, she may be able to provide insight into her sire's current state of mind.

Aymeric

-- Well reasoned. To the Dravanian forelands, then.

Tataru

-- A nice young knight told me you were off to negotiate with Hraesvelgr again. Have you considered using the Manderville art of parley? It's surprisingly effective, you know!

Vidofnir

-- Ah, 'tis the warrior of warriors and her companions. What bringeth you to mine abode?

Alphinaud

-- Pray forgive us for disturbing your recuperation, Vidofnir. I hope your wound does not pain you overmuch...

Vidofnir

-- Didst thou imagine me close to death? The thrust was deep, but not mortal. I will heal in time.

Aymeric

-- Full glad am I to hear it. You were the guest of honor at our conference, and we failed in our duty of protection. On behalf of Ishgard, I apologize unreservedly.

Vidofnir

-- ...I am a dragon full-grown, and thou thought to protect me, mortal? I was tempered by the fires of battle ere thy great-grandsire learned to crawl. Thy words do remind me of a knight whom I called friend some thousand years past. He swore to defend me from harm and hardship...

Aymeric

-- Would that we could return to that era of peace, when man and dragon knew such comradeship.

Alphinaud

-- Would that our every effort to do so were not undone by ancient rancor...

Vidofnir

-- For a truth, there can be no peace while Nidhogg's shade yet lingereth.

Alphinaud

-- That much is plain─yet we lack the strength to banish him. Thus do we make for Sohm Al, to beseech the aid of your sire once more.

Vidofnir

-- Folly. Thou know'st as well as I how he will answer.

Aymeric

-- ...Hraesvelgr's heart remains unchanged, then. A pity. But if it is folly to hope, I am content to die a fool.

Vidofnir

-- As hath ever been the way with thy kind. Go then, but be warned: the shade's presence hath driven its minions to frenzy.

Alphinaud

-- Thank you, Vidofnir. We shall disturb your rest no longer.

Vidofnir

-- 'Tis folly to believe thy words might sway the heart of my sire. ...Yet I wish thee fortune in thy endeavor, nonetheless.

Aymeric

-- Lucia's report described Anyx Trine in detail, but her words failed to convey the overwhelming strangeness of standing here in the demesne of dragons.

<div class="border p-6">
It would seem that Ser Aymeric has a favor to ask. Now that Nidhogg is possessed of both of his eyes, the lord commander believes that there is only one being capable of standing against the vengeful shade─Nidhogg's own brood-brother, Hraesvelgr. As such, he would have you escort him to Zenith, and aid him in convincing the great wyrm to stand with Ishgard. Though Alphinaud harbors understandable doubts as to the wisdom of this course, it is plain that Ser Aymeric will not be swayed. Notify the lord commander when you are ready to depart.

Though Ser Aymeric is ready to ascend Sohm Al, he acquiesces to Alphinaud's suggestion that you first visit Vidofnir at Anyx Trine. Travel to the Dravanian forelands, and speak with the wounded dragon.

Vidofnir dismisses your concern regarding her injury, but can offer little in the way of hope for your intended audience with her sire. Disheartened but not dissuaded, Ser Aymeric resolves to press on into the Churning Mists.

# Win Over the Wyrm 🎧

<div class="border p-6">
System Guide

-- Alphinaud seems eager to press on.

Alphinaud

-- Though I expected no better answer from Vidofnir, I take little pleasure from having been proven right. 'Twould seem that our presence at Zenith will be every bit as unwelcome as I had anticipated. But what is the ire of one great wyrm to a trio of self-confessed fools such as ourselves? Let us begin our ascent.

Aymeric

-- After you, Master Alphinaud.

Alphinaud

-- Scout ahead if you wish, Luna. We shall join you outside Moghome!

Alphinaud

-- The lord commander seems lost for words. Nor can I blame him. I recall being similarly awestruck when I first beheld this vista.

Aymeric

-- I had heard tales of the world above the clouds, but never did I dream... One's mind paints a pale picture of its majesty.

Alphinaud

-- Few live to see such wonders. I am reminded of my first visit to this peak, when Estinien and Ysayle yet walked at our side...

Churning Mists Moogle

-- Kupopo? Is that you, Luna?

Alphinaud

-- Ah, if it isn't Mog... Mog...uh...

Churning Mists Moogle

-- Don't tell me you've forgotten my name, kupo!? After all we've been through together!

-- But at least you remember me! You...you do remember me, don't you, Luna?

Me

-- (Option 1) How could I forget you, Moglin!
-- (Option 2) Of course I do, Moghan!
-- (Option 3) Apologies, friend, but all moogles look the same to me...

Moghan

-- (In response to 1) H-How could you mistake me for that overstuffed throne-warmer!? I'm Moghan! The courageous moogle who guided you to Zenith, kupo!
-- (In response to 2) Phew! You seemed a bit hesitant for a moment there! But I'm sure you were just fondly recalling the time we camped near Zenith, right, kupo?
-- (In response to 3) ...I see, kupo. Then I suppose our time around the campfire meant less to you than I thought it did. It's “Moghan,” by the way... <sniff>

-- But putting our shared history to one side, what brings you and your friends to Moghome, kupo?

-- Ah, another audience with old Hraesvelgr... Well, I hope you've brought the horn, kupo! With the winds as gentle as they are, a good loud toot should reach the great wyrm's ears easily enough!

Alphinaud

-- That is good to hear, Moghan─thank you. We had best press on to Zenith, while the winds are in our favor.

Moghan

-- Now that was unexpected, kupo. Chieftain Moglin will want to hear about this!

-- Did you meet with Hraesvelgr already, kupo? You never know when the winds will pick up again!

Aymeric

-- We must win Hraesvelgr to our cause. Fail in this and Ishgard's fate is all but sealed.

Alphinaud

-- Pray sound the horn, Luna.

Hraesvelgr

-- You dare summon me again, mortals?

Alphinaud

-- Great Hraesvelgr, 'tis not lightly that we beg this audience. Pray hearken to our words, for they concern the future of man and dragon both.

Aymeric

-- Greetings, Hraesvelgr. I am Aymeric de Borel, acting ruler of the nation of Ishgard. I am come before you to parley on behalf of my people.

Hraesvelgr

-- ...To parley? Thinkest thou thy purpose unclear to me? Thou art come to beg mine aid in the battle against the shade of my brood-brother.

Aymeric

-- You...foresaw mine intent.

Hraesvelgr

-- I but read that which is writ plain in thine eyes. Would that thou had wit enough to scry the answer in mine. My beloved Shiva did once build a bridge 'twixt man and dragon─a bridge which thy treacherous forefathers saw fit to tear down, as thou well knowest. Thinkest thou Nidhogg was alone in despairing at the murder of our brood-sister? Thinkest thou mine own soul did not cry out for vengeance? Know then that upon that accursed day, my heart did wither in my breast, and thy kind become unto me the harbingers of despair. 'Tis only Shiva's gentle dream that preventeth me from flying at Nidhogg's shoulder. Be grateful that I swore to abjure aggression ere I consumed her. I permit my children to offer or deny thee aid as they see fit; to warn thy people of my brood-brother's coming. That thou wouldst dare ask more of me but affirmeth thine incurable arrogance.

Alphinaud

-- We understand that in your despair at man's betrayal, you seek only the refuge of solitude. But despite your protestations of spent faith, do you not still nurture the smallest flame of hope?

Hraesvelgr

-- Perceivest thou such light in the dusk of mine existence?

Alphinaud

-- I do. If you claim I see falsely, then tell me: why did you consent to bear Ysayle upon your back?

Hraesvelgr

-- Ysayle... Piteous, deluded Ysayle. The child did lament her past sins, and sought to balance the scales with her remaining days. 'Twas her unquenchable passion, so alike to that of my beloved, which did spur me into flight. And for mine own part, I would countenance no longer the hands of evil men to use my brood-brother's eye for ill.

Alphinaud

-- So you do distinguish between those who acknowledge and repent their sins, and those who perpetuate them. Interesting.

-- It seems to me that you have not, in fact, lost faith in mankind as a whole. Rather, you weigh our respective merits by how we allow the past to influence our future.

Hraesvelgr

-- Spare me thine idle sophistry. Even were there a mote of truth in thy reasoning, what of it? Wouldst thou have me slay mine own sibling to save a city of mortals?

Aymeric

-- Should we suffer ties of blood to bind our hands then? Nay. If the crime is one of unconscionable evil, we must needs condemn it─even should the transgressor be our closest kin. When my father corrupted himself and his followers with the power of a primal, I beseeched the Warrior of Light to slay him─an act alike to patricide.

-- That he did not die by my hand matters little─if anything, it heaps greater disgrace upon my name. But had my father not fallen, he would have drawn countless thousands into a holy war of hellish proportions─which I hold the greater crime. Thus did I order his execution, sparing the lives of my people and yours.

-- Alas, your brother wyrm now prepares to murder those whom I sought to spare. What is more, he has taken my comrade's body for his own─but if I must slay my dearest friend to defeat my direst foe, I will not flinch from my duty!

Hraesvelgr

-- Thou wouldst strike down thy friend and, by example of thy righteousness, persuade me to break mine oath and kill my kindred?

Midgardsormr

-- Heed me, my child. The servants of Hydaelyn envision a different outcome. They intend salvation not only for Ishgard, but for the doomed dragonslayer as well. Believest thou this shade to be Nidhogg returned? Is it not merely a manifestation of his vengeance─the shadow cast by thy brood-brother's rage? I would not command thee, but ponder well thy course lest it lead thee unto greater remorse...

Me

-- (Option 1) While this shade of vengeance remains, the future will ever be uncertain.
-- (Option 2) Help us save our companion.
-- (Option 3) ...

Hraesvelgr

-- (In response to 1) Nidhogg's transformation into rage incarnate is, in part, of mine own doing. I rendered unto him mine eye, and empowered his revenge thereby... But 'tis the purity of my brood-brother's wrath that lendeth him his all-surpassing might.
-- (In response to 2) Thou wishest to rescue the dragoon from his fate along with all the rest? I do begin to see why Ysayle entrusted her hope unto thee. Thy purpose is pure. ...But so too is my brood-brother's wrath, and 'tis that which lendeth him his all-surpassing might.
-- (In response to 3) What, no words for me, warrior? I take it thou art resolved to act whether I aid thee or no... Ha! I do admire thy determination.

-- Hast thou the strength of will to stand against so terrible a shadow, I wonder? 'Twould seem I must put thee and thy companions to the proof. I shall await thee in the ruins wherein Ratatoskr once dwelled. Heed well the words of my children, and hasten thee to the place of thy trial!

Alphinaud

-- Another day, another trial. Such ordeals must seem almost mundane to you by now. Would that I could say the same.

Aymeric

-- I believe I spied a wyvern landing just outside the palace. It is doubtless one of the “children” of whom Hraesvelgr spoke. Come, my friends: let us not keep our escort waiting.

-- For the sake of Ishgard, I shall overcome whatever trial is placed before me. And I have no doubt that you will do the same, Luna.

Imperious Wyvern

-- My broodmates and I will bear you to the place of your trial. Make your preparations.

Sohr Khai (Dungeon Descrption)

Majestic and forgotten, its existence unrecorded in the annals of man, a palace rests atop the clouds in the farthest reaches of the Churning Mists. This skyborne splendor was once home to Ratatoskr, brood-sister to Hraesvelgr and Nidhogg, until the treachery of mortals ensured that its stones would never again ring under the she-wyrm's talons. The dragons named it “Sohr Khai,” a grieving apology for their failure to avert her fate, and they watched with infinite sadness as Ratatoskr's empty roost was overrun by bird and beast.

This is the place Hraesvelgr has chosen for your trial. Prove yourself in the faded shadow of one sibling, and convince the great wyrm to aid you against the wrathful shade of the other.

Hraesvelgr

-- Even bereft of an eye, my brood-brother was a fearsome foe indeed. But having tasted thy strength firsthand, full well can I imagine how thou didst bring him low. The dread title of “Azure Dragoon” is no empty appellation. Very well. I shall trust in the seed of man one last time. By thy deeds shall the flickering hope that lingereth yet within my heart be kindled anew...or extinguished forever.

-- That you yet stand is ready proof of your determination, mortals.

-- Let us fight as allies, then, and together banish my brood-brother's vengeful shade. On my oath, the wrath that once was Nidhogg shall meet its end!

-- This I swear on the memory of my beloved Shiva, and on the soul of lost Ysayle...

Imperious Wyvern

-- You have proven yourself in the eyes of great Hraesvelgr. I did not think such a thing possible...

Aymeric

-- Countless times have I fought the minions of Nidhogg, but never did I imagine that I would one day face Hraesvelgr himself.

Alphinaud

-- Oh...ohhh... Oh, my poor ribs... That was a painful reminder of a great wyrm's might...

Aymeric

-- And had he truly meant us harm, we would not be standing here now. Plainly, his intent was to teach. His onslaught forced me to recall my training─about the speed of the dragon, his balance, his blind spots... It was, in short, a very thorough lesson.

Moglin

-- Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow...kupo. Luna, let me begin by congratulating you on the completion of your trial. For one with a name more befitting a jester, you fight with the savagery of a rabid demon. Do you see how my wings are kinked? Even my pom aches! After this drubbing, I fear my loyal subjects will have to bear the load of my personal chores for quite some time, kupo. Possibly indefinitely.

Moghan

-- What!? When I told you about Luna's trial, I didn't mean for the rest of us to suffer...

Moglin

-- ...That's triple shifts for you, Moghan.

Moghan

-- <splutter> Triple!? But that's not fair!!! There's no justice, kupo... None at all!

Alphinaud

-- Our negotiations proved rather more strenuous than I had anticipated, but the results seem well worth the effort.

Aymeric

-- The battle was indeed hard-won. Thank you, my friends─I would never have earned Hraesvelgr's cooperation had you not seen fit to grant me yours. 'Twas your stalwart heroism that moved the heart of the great wyrm at the last. Any gratitude I can offer is but poor reward for your continued service to Ishgard.

Alphinaud

-- 'Twould seem our final reckoning with the dread wyrm is at hand. I only wish we had some inkling as to when he means to strike.

-- Oh gods!

Midgardsormr

-- The cry heraldeth his coming. Nidhogg's shade hath taken wing.

Despite Vidofnir's predictably gloomy appraisal of your chances, Alphinaud is resolved to lead Ser Aymeric to the summit of Sohm Al. Rejoin your companions outside Moghome, and signal your readiness to depart to the lord commander.

As Ser Aymeric shares his wonder at the incredible vista, you are suddenly hailed by Moghan, the moogle who first guided you to Zenith. Upon learning of your purpose in the Churning Mists, he assures you that the winds are perfect for carrying your call to Hraesvelgr's ears. Make your way to Zenith, and blow the moogles' horn once more.

You look on as Hraesvelgr descends from the clouds, just as he did when first you came to Zenith─and wince inwardly as he greets your request for aid with the selfsame scorn. Undaunted, Aymeric and Alphinaud strive to win the great wyrm round with eloquence and reason, but it is not until Midgardsormr himself appears that Hraesvelgr finally assents to test you and your companions' resolve. Consult with Ser Aymeric on how best to approach the forthcoming trial.

Ser Aymeric informs you that he observed a wyvern landing just outside the palace, and concludes that it must be one of the “children” of whom Hraesvelgr spoke. Accost the waiting dragon.

It would seem that the wyvern has come to bear you to the scene of your ordeal. Steel yourself, body and mind, for the trials of so ancient and powerful a being as Hraesvelgr are not like to be simple...nor less forgiving.

You have weathered the trial of the great wyrm. Before returning to Zenith, it would seem wise to speak with Hraesvelgr.

Hraesvelgr commends you and your companions for your unwavering determination, and pledges to aid you in the coming battle with Nidhogg. Inquire of Alphinaud how he fared in his own trial.

Your trials completed, Alphinaud ponders how much time you have to prepare for Nidhogg's assault. Scarcely have the words left his lips, however, when a thunderous roar echoes across the sky, signaling the advance of the Dravanian Horde. The time has come for the final reckoning with Nidhogg─to bring an end to his wrathful song.
