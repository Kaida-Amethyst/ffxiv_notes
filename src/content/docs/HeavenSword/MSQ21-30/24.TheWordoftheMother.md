-- Alphinaud is eager to return to the search for Minfilia.

Alphinaud

-- Thancred and Krile contacted us a short while ago. It would seem that their foray into Castrum Meridianum bore fruit. They ask that we rendezvous with them and Y'shtola in Idyllshire, where they will share their findings. Rude though it is to depart without speaking to the guest of honor, I expect she will forgive me if I return with her daughter.

Tataru

-- What are you still doing here? They're waiting for you in Idyllshire!

Y'shtola

-- 'Twas rather less than I had hoped...though mayhap I asked too much.

Thancred

-- How is F'lhaminn, by the way? Enchanting as ever, I trust. I shall have to pay my respects when time allows.

Alphinaud

-- My apologies, I see I am the last to arrive. So─what news have you for us?

Krile

-- Well, as we postulated, there were indeed what appeared to be the remnants of an unexplained disturbance in the aether at the scene of the Ultima Weapon's destruction. A ripple at odds with the presiding pattern. Though faint, the waveforms bore a strong resemblance to those observed following the destruction of the Isle of Val─when I believe Hydaelyn shielded me with the blessing of Light.

Thancred

-- To confirm our findings, we paid a visit to the Sil'dih Aqueducts. There we detected the same waveform, but orders of magnitude larger...as one would expect of a more recent disturbance.

Y'shtola

-- Hydaelyn. There is no other explanation.

Krile

-- But there is more. When I studied the site where Y'shtola used Flow, it appeared that not two but three beings had been affected. Yet unlike Y'shtola and Thancred, there was no trail to follow. Our unknown third party was simply there...and then not there. Now, recall your visions of a vast crystal floating in a sea of aether. Though this too is but a theory, studies of gifted subjects suggest that, when communing with Hydaelyn, we briefly leave our bodies behind. So, let us consider the facts. One─Hydaelyn interceded. Two─a third being was caught in Y'shtola's Flow and vanished without a trace. And three─Hydaelyn may have the capacity to summon the consciousness of gifted individuals to Her side.

Y'shtola

-- You are implying, I take it, that Hydaelyn guided Minfilia into the compass of my magick...that She might summon her, body and soul, unto the aetherial sea? In which case, we must needs continue our search there. For a blessing, the means to do so already exists. I speak of the Antitower─a Sharlayan construction conceived to provide scholars a vantage point over the aetherial sea. Though I know not where its entrance lies, we need only ask its last custodian─a contrary old crone who, for another blessing, refused to join the exodus.

Alphinaud

-- Master Matoya was the keeper of the Antitower!? I had no idea... Then our course is clear. We must petition her aid once again.

Matoya

-- Oh, what a surprise. Well? What secrets have you come to extract from me this time?

Alphinaud

-- Ah. Though it pains me to admit it, your words strike close to the mark. We humbly ask that you grant us entry to the Antitower, that we might use it to seek a friend who we believe has been transported to the aetherial sea.

Matoya

-- And who told you I could do such a thing, I wonder. The tower was abandoned to its magical keepers fifteen years ago. They have the run of the place now. If that is no deterrent to you, then by all means.

Y'shtola

-- Is that all? I felt sure you would seek to dissuade us from our course, given your role as custodian.

Matoya

-- Role? Hardly. The Forum foisted the title on me. During the exodus, every entrance to the Antitower was sealed save one. My role consists of making sure no one with ill intent sneaks through it. Such was the Forum's final “order” to me. Well? I can remove the wards right now. Will you be going or not?

Krile

-- We will, Master Matoya. We will do whatever it takes to find Minfilia!

Matoya

-- ...We'll see about that.

-- You, Baldesion girl─you're staying here with me. I need your help to restore the wards to their original state. The rest of you can go─on the condition that you clean up the mess in the tower. If you encounter any unruly familiars, you're to tend to them. Those are my terms, and I'll hear no argument.

Thancred

-- Well, it appears the mistress has spoken. Lead the way, Luna.

Krile

-- To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what you'll need to do once you reach the bottom...but you've always been so resourceful, so...

Matoya

-- Fair warning, but the arcane entities in the Antitower are a troublesome lot. Try not to die in there.

Alphinaud

-- The Antitower is the sole reason a Sharlayan settlement existed in Eorzea. One cannot overstate the structure's importance.

Thancred

-- Whatever it takes, we will find Minfilia. Whatever it takes.

Y'shtola

-- Long did I wonder what awaited beyond that door. Several times in my youth, I even tried to open it, but the wards were beyond my ability to dispel. All I earned for my efforts was a mountain of menial chores, and I had given up on ever satisfying my curiosity. To think that I'm about to step through the threshold after all these years...

In all of creation, what greater mystery could there be than the fate of this very star? To sound the deepest depths, to study the aetherial sea itself─for these purposes and more was the Antitower built. Abandoned by her Sharlayan caretakers following the exodus, it has since been overrun by the magical guardians they left behind. Yet were one blessed with Her gift to brave these dangers and descend to the furthest reaches─to hear, feel, and think at the heart of this world─what would they find?

The Word of the Mother

-- Through time and space hast thou journeyed unto me...as I knew thou wouldst. We are the Word of the Mother. We who were once called “Minfilia.” Much time hath passed for thee, since the bloody banquet. Since...since I hearkened to Her word. Mother... Hydaelyn guided me...towards Y'shtola and Thancred, that I might be swept up in their Flow...and delivered unto the aetherial sea... There, adrift and alone, Her voice silent once more, I prayed... For those we have lost. For those we can yet save. To Her I would make an offering... We speak now with one Voice. One Will. One Word. Unto thee we bequeath the most precious of gifts: the truth which lieth at the heart of this world.

-- Thus do we beseech thee once more... Hear... Feel... Think...

-- Before there was life, in the depths of the aetherial sea, Light and Dark did once dwell as one. But the Darkness coveted power, and the balance was broken. Thus was I forced to banish Him unto the distant heavens, to forever remain apart. A moon bound. In sundering the star did we cry out, and the barriers 'twixt planes chance to falter. Across ten and three were we then divided. Reflections of the Source, each possessed of a shard. Zodiark longeth to be made whole. For His restoration, for His resurrection, His servants labor without cease. They seek to tear down the barriers which surround the Source. Thus do they rejoice in their Ardor─in your calamities─for each marks a Rejoining. Seven times have they succeeded. Seven times hath the Darkness grown stronger. Seven times have I failed.

-- The Ascians cannot be suffered to continue. This...this is my final...

-- The Crystal's power is all but spent. With what remains, I will return you to the shore of the aetherial sea.

-- Blessed children, go forth and seek...seek...

Alphinaud

-- You've had another vision, haven't you? Let us return to Master Matoya's cave. Everyone will wish to hear what you saw.

Matoya

-- Still in one piece, are we? Well? Did you learn anything?

Alphinaud

-- The Word of the Mother...? I am not sure I understand.

Y'shtola

-- Nor am I. Krile?

Krile

-- As unbelievable as it sounds, I see no reason to doubt her─the Word's tale. No one was more sensitive to the will of Hydaelyn than Minfilia.

-- And if Hydaelyn has grown so weak that She can barely make Herself heard, it is not hard to see why Minfilia, having joined with Her, might struggle to maintain her own form.

Alphinaud

-- What? Why would she need to “maintain her own form”? Are you saying─ Are you saying she's gone?

-- But that cannot be! Not now, not after all we have accomplished! We were meant to usher in the dawn's light together!

Matoya

-- She threw herself on the fire to fuel your “dawn's light,” boy. You'll just have to usher it in on your own.

Y'shtola

-- Must you be so ungentle!?

Matoya

-- 	Tell me about the Scions, boy.

Alphinaud

-- The...the Scions of the Seventh Dawn labor for Eorzea's salvation. Whenever the realm is threatened, be it by primal, Ascian, Garlean or any other, we take up arms in her defense, that all in Eorzea may live to see a brighter tomorrow.

Matoya

-- And that's very noble of you. But in chasing after these lofty goals of yours, you seem to have lost sight of some basic truths. To win a war, you must be willing to do whatever it takes. To fight, to kill, and, if necessary, to die. The path you've chosen is paved with the dead. Walk it with your eyes open, or not at all.

Y'shtola

-- I know the truth of which you speak, and have from the first. If the Ascians will go to any lengths to resurrect their god, then we must needs be as committed to our cause─to unmask them and their schemes, and to crush them both utterly.

-- Come. There is much to be done.

Krile

-- Y-Yes, of course.

Alphinaud

-- Thancred, wait!

-- No... No, this is all wrong.

Matoya

-- 'Tis a blessed few who get to choose how and when and for what they die. Not that you need reminding, I suppose. But that boy... <sigh> For all the suffering he has known, he still clings to the notion that there is a cosmic justice, a morality by which we are saved or condemned. And there isn't.

Alphinaud

-- She...she's not coming back, is she.

ME

-- (Option 1) She did what she thought was best.
-- (Option 2) ...What now?
-- (Option 3) ...

Alphinaud

-- (Response 1) I know that, I do. To give all for her beliefs was ever her way. So will we, as we must. What greater calling could there be than to stand against the Dark as defenders of the Light? And yet...where does it end? The sacrifice, the loss...

-- (Response 2) ...We carry on, as we must. She went to great lengths to inform us of the enemy's designs. We stand, as ever, against the Dark, as defenders of the Light. Yet for how long, I wonder. How much more loss must we endure...?

-- (Response 3) It weighs on you too, I know. I understand why she made her decision, and yet... Every time we lose another friend, I have to ask myself if there was not another way...

It would seem that Krile and Thancred's foray into Castrum Meridianum was a success. According to Alphinaud, the pair have called a meeting in Idyllshire, where they will share their findings. But what could they have learned, and how might it lead you to the Antecedent?

You learn that after concluding their investigation in the Praetorium, Krile and Thancred journeyed to the Sil'dih Aqueducts, where Minfilia was last seen. Apparently, the readings from these two locations yielded a unique aetheric signature─one which was also detected at the Isle of Val, where Krile claims she was shielded by the blessing of Light. The conclusion is clear: Hydaelyn's intercessions can be measured and traced. Furthermore, Krile states that not two but three people were caught in Y'shtola's Flow. Unlike the Archons, however, the third individual appears to have vanished without a trace. Though it is something of a logical leap, Krile surmises that Hydaelyn─who has a demonstrated capacity to summon the consciousness of those blessed with the Echo to Her realm─may have guided Minfilia into the teleportation magick's compass, and thence summoned her, body and soul, unto the aetherial sea. Should this be the case, then the search must continue in that near-mythical place. Fortunately, it would seem that the Sharlayans built a structure to study the aetherial sea, and that its custodian yet remains, in defiance of the exodus...

All things come at a price, and Matoya's permission is no different. Although she grants your company access to the Antitower, she demands that Krile stays behind to help her restore the ward over the door, while you are to tend to any unruly familiars you encounter. Knowing better than to argue the terms, you quietly prepare to sally forth into the Sharlayan structure.

As you drive back the last of the tower's magical guardians and silence descends, you take in your surroundings. What was it you thought to find here, in this forgotten place, left to molder until the end of time? And then, on the edge of hearing, a voice. “Hear... Feel... Think...”

Once more, you bask in the light of the Crystal, in the midst of the aetherial sea. A voice, familiar yet strange, welcomes you; Minfilia's at times, but at others... She calls herself the Word of the Mother, and with one will do they tell you a tale of the beginning─of when Light and Dark dwelt as one, before Zodiark's covetousness forced Hydaelyn to banish Him to the distant heavens. Not only was the star sundered in so doing, but the barriers between realities as well, giving birth to reflections of the Source, wherein shards of light and dark were scattered. To restore Zodiark to His former glory do the Ascians ever labor, and each Calamity marks a Rejoining─the obliteration of a reflection, and a triumph of the Dark. Alas, before she can say more, the Word cries out in pain, and the Mothercrystal shudders. Your Crystal of Light, whose power she drew upon, is all but spent, and she has no choice but to return you to the tower. With a final desperate plea, the Word bids you farewell, before shattering into a thousand thousand pieces.

Upon returning to Matoya's Cave, your fellow Scions listen in solemn silence as you tell of your meeting with Minfilia, and of her transformation into the Word of the Mother. Alphinaud, at last realizing the implications of your encounter, cries out in despair for the loss of your leader, prompting Master Matoya to scold him for his childish naivety. She reminds him that wars are not won without sacrifice─that Minfilia made her choice, and that the Scions must move forward without her. Unimpressed by her lecture, Y'shtola leaves with Krile in tow, while Thancred storms out without uttering a word, leaving you alone with Alphinaud and Matoya.

Though he does his best to accept that Minfilia made her choice, and that you must carry on without her, Alphinaud cannot help but wonder if there was not another way. Loss after loss, sacrifice upon sacrifice... Your victories have ever come at a price─one which Alphinaud seems increasingly unwilling to pay.

Alphinaud

-- I must ask that you not breathe a word of this to any of the others at the Rising Stones─especially F'lhaminn. I will brief Tataru on what we have learned, as well as Urianger. He may have insight into what the Word told us. As for you, Luna...after all you have done, I would say you have earned a rest.

-- Ah, but speaking of well-earned rewards─I received a missive from Ser Aymeric while you were away. 'Twould seem he is planning a ceremony of some sort, and would like you to attend. He did not divulge the details, preferring instead to explain in person. Mayhap you should pay him a visit?

-- Pray take some time to rest. I think I may as well. Oh, and should you decide to visit Ser Aymeric at the Congregation, do be sure to give him my regards.

Aymeric

-- A pleasure to see you again, my friend. I take it you received our invitation? Good, good... You of all people should be present.

-- When the True Brothers of the Faith seized control of the Vault, I feared the worst. Yet in adversity were we blessed with the promise of peace between man and dragon, through Vidofnir's timely rescue of an innocent child. Timely, I say, though “miraculous” or “providential” might better describe the event. The gods themselves could not have devised a more fitting symbol of hope. Needless to say, we could scarce let such an opportunity pass us by, which is why I set about making formal arrangements for a peace conference between our peoples.

-- You and yours have done more to bring us together than any, and it is only right that you attend.

-- But, I confess, that is not the only reason I would be glad to have you there. Given Nidhogg's implacable opposition to the peace, it is possible that he and his followers may attempt to disrupt proceedings, in which event, your presence would be a comfort to all in attendance. Pray understand, I have no wish to invite the wyrm's ire, but if our fractured nation is to heal─if we are to move forward as a people united─then we must do whatever is necessary to bring about lasting change.

-- 'Tis nothing, 'tis nothing. <sigh> Lucia cautioned me against giving vent to my passions, lest my wounds reopen.

-- It has not been easy reaching out to our opponents in Ishgard, many of whom sympathized with the actions of the “True Brothers.” But in so doing, we have limited the influence of the zealots. The people are ready, my friend. This conference must go ahead!

-- I knew you would understand. The conference will take place on the border of Ishgardian and Dravanian territory, in Falcon's Nest. Lucia is there seeing to the final preparations even as we speak. Pray join her at your earliest convenience─'twould not do for the guest of honor to arrive late, after all.

-- Oh, and one more thing!

-- A drink! We should make time for one. Once the conference is concluded, I mean. By my reckoning, 'tis long overdue.

-- Well met, Mistress Kali. Have you spoken with the first commander yet?

Emmanellain

-- Oh! Fancy running into you here, old girl. Gave me a bit of a shock. We'll talk later, yes?

Honoroit

-- (Thank the Fury you are here, Mistress Kali. I am not sure what my lord intends...and that troubles me far more than when I do.)

Highborn Merchant

-- Peace between dragon and man. I would have scoffed at it not long ago but now, after seeing that dragon pluck that girl from the sky, well... If this is to be the moment, then my wife and I would witness it firsthand.

Lowborn Youth

-- By the Fury, would you look at the size of it! Got any idea what it'll look like when they've finished?

Spirited Stonecutter

-- I don't envy them poor sods what have to work atop that scaffolding, exposed to the wind and all. Aye, it's for a good cause, but better them than me!

Lucia

-- The lord commander said you would come, Luna. As you can see, preparations for the conference are proceeding apace. Mark well the curtain above. It conceals a relief that will be unveiled during the conference. The masons labor day and night to see it finished on schedule. Ser Aymeric wanted a symbol which would endure long after this conference is concluded. I think he will be pleased with the result.

-- 'Twas not my war, but I made it mine...and to see it draw closer to a resolution fills me with a strange hope. His faith is infectious, is it not? His certainty that we can be better than we are...

-- Forgive me, I am rambling. You must be tired from your journey. Go, rest. I will not keep you.

Although Alphinaud intends to inform Tataru and Urianger of Minfilia's fate, he asks that you share with no one else what you have learned─especially F'lhaminn. He then states that you have more than earned a rest, only to suddenly recall that he but recently received a missive from Ser Aymeric. It would seem that the lord commander is planning a ceremony of some sort and would like you to attend. However, he neglected to provide details, and so a visit to the Congregation appears to be in order.

Never one to let an opportunity pass him by, Ser Aymeric wishes to take advantage of the recent shift in public sentiment towards the Dravanians to reestablish relations with their neighbors. To that end, he has begun making formal arrangements for a peace conference in Falcon's Nest, to be attended by Vidofnir...and by you, if possible. He admits that your presence would be more than a symbolic gesture, as he fears that Nidhogg and his followers may attempt to disrupt the proceedings. Moved by his passion, you agree, and prepare to leave for Falcon's Nest and speak with Lucia. In that moment, however, Ser Aymeric calls out, asking that you share a drink once the conference has concluded─doubtless a gesture of gratitude and camaraderie. Yet, in that moment, a thought unbidden of a woman in white floating before a great crystal gives you pause...and though you accept his invitation, it is with a heavy heart.

Most are blessed with precious few chances to choose their course in life, and Lucia is no different. Dispatched to a foreign nation as a spy, it was her duty to infiltrate Ishgardian society for her masters' ends. In the end, however, she chose a different path─to pledge herself to another nation's cause, and to join in their war. As she watches the masons of Falcon's Nest put the finishing touches on a relief, she reflects on what that war's resolution could mean for her...and for the country whose faith she has come to share.

# Staunch Conviction

```plaintext
Syetem Guide

-- Lucia is concerned that you seem to be looking for something to do.

Artoirel

-- Will it truly be enough, I wonder...

Emmanellain

-- Ah...still here, old girl? This, uh...this really isn't the time.

Honoroit

-- (I will do my utmost to keep him out of trouble, but I may require your assistance later...)

Highborn Merchant

-- I suppose we came a bit early, didn't we? Nevertheless, better early than late!

Lowborn Youth

-- Have you peeked behind the curtain? Care to tell us what you saw?

Spirited Stonecutter

-- More and more folk are drifting into Falcon's Nest. Most ain't quite sure what to expect, I reckon. Quite frankly, neither am I...

Lucia

-- If you would rather not take a rest, then why not take a walk around Falcon's Nest? Make your presence known to the people and so forth. In addition to those who have come from far and wide to attend this ceremony, you may meet lords Artoirel and Emmanellain, who have graciously volunteered their services. They should be glad to see you. Now, if you would excuse me, I must needs return to my duties.

Artoirel

-- Taking a stroll around the hamlet? Very good, very good. We shall speak anon.

Redwald

-- I am glad to see that the rumors were true! Well met, Mistress Kali, and fear not─I've no intention of begging your aid with this or that. Everything appears to be in order. My only lingering concern is that one of the Convictors might not have been informed of our plans. As I recall, Vidofnir may pass directly over their encampment. The last thing we need is a glory-seeking nobleman attempting to slay a Dravanian ambassador to a peace conference...

-- Pay me no mind. Worrying over unlikely possibilities is my duty. Yours is to relax and enjoy the festivities.
 
Lowborn Youth

-- Do you know when everything's set to begin? I wasn't sure how many might come, so I thought it best to come early and find a spot with a great view. When I heard that Ser Aymeric was planning to make a speech, I knew I couldn't miss it. I mean, the man risked his own neck to rescue those hostages! How often do we get heroes like that in this day and age? And he's more than a fighter, too─he's a thinker, he is. He's got plans to better our lives. To change things. And he'll do it, by the Fury. Me and my friends and family, we all believe he can do it.

-- Where is everyone else? Don't they know what they're missing?

Rothe

-- Bloody excitin', isn't it? Not just peace with the dragons, but with all them heretics besides! Don't misunderstand─we've all got a healthy fear of being bathed in dragon fire. That being said, the heretics did far more to hinder our efforts here in the past, so hearin' that we're close to a reconciliation comes as a great relief! 

-- If the dragons haven't got reason to fight, then neither will the heretics. Thank the Fury for that.

Artoirel

-- How much has changed since we fought alongside each other in the Vault. If you had told me then that we would soon be hosting a peace conference, I would have thought you a naive fool. Yet here we are, preparing to make that fantasy a reality. Hah─and here I am, laboring to make it so.

Lucia

-- Lord Artoirel, if I may.

Artoirel

-- Certainly, First Commander. How may I be of service?

Lucia

-- Some of the Convictors are refusing to stand down. The majority were willing to do so, but a small party have instead pledged to engage any Dravanians bound for Falcon's Nest.

Artoirel

-- Fury take me, they would defy Ser Aymeric's commands!? If they dare attack Vidofnir─

Lucia

-- It will not come to that. But to see that it does not, we must needs hasten to their encampment. They should be far more reluctant to oppose us were a lord of House Fortemps present.

Artoirel

-- I understand completely. Let us depart at once.

-- But ere we do, I must ask: would you look after Emmanellain while I am away? As you know, he has ever been an impulsive, changeable child, but recently he seems to have been suffering from a bout of melancholy. I thought to lift his spirits by having him assist with guard duty─a simple but honorable charge, unlikely to expose him to danger given the presence of so many other knights. Alas, he has taken no interest, and I fear he may abandon his post in my absence. All I ask is that you keep an eye on him until I return...exhausting though that may be.

-- Thank you, my friend. I promise we will not be long.

Resigned to the simple truth that you will never be content to do absolutely nothing, Lucia suggests that you take a stroll about Falcon's Nest and speak with the various peoples who have come to attend the conference. She also makes mention that lords Artoirel and Emmanellain should be nearby, as both have graciously volunteered their services.

Though they come from different walks of life, the Ishgardians with whom you speak all share a similar hope for peace, however unimaginable it might feel. The two young lords of House Fortemps are not difficult to find, but Emmanellain seems disinclined to conversation. Perhaps his older brother will be more obliging.

As you converse with Lord Artoirel about recent affairs, Lucia abruptly appears and announces that a party of Convictors has refused to stand down, and have instead pledged to engage any Dravanians they spy flying towards Falcon's Nest. Needless to say, such an act could spell disaster for the peace conference, and the first commander intends to ride out to the Convictory and resolve the situation in person. Lord Artoirel, she feels, would only strengthen her claim, as he can speak with the authority of House Fortemps. The young lord agrees, and before he departs he asks that you look after his younger brother, who he fears may fail to carry out his duties in his absence.

# Once More, a Favor

System Guide

-- Emmanellain is less than his usual effervescent self.

Highborn Merchant

-- What sort of trade opportunities might there be? I've never thought about it before, but do the Dravanians even have markets?

Lowborn Youth

-- Everything is going to be all right. I know it will.

Spirited Stonecutter

-- Do you think we'll have to let them come and go as they please? In the capital, I mean. Our roads weren't exactly designed for Dravanians...

Honoroit

-- Hm? Was that Lord Artoirel leaving with the first commander just now?

Emmanellain

-- I'm rather busy at the moment, old girl. Guarding this tavern, as it were. Oh, I see now. Artoirel thought I might be derelict in my duties, eh? The nerve of my brother to question my dedication! ...But since you are here, mayhap I can put you to proper use. The wasteland beyond the walls must be kept safe for travelers, yet I have been forbidden from leaving Falcon's Nest. It wouldn't do for our esteemed guests to be devoured by wolves, oh no. Yet that is precisely what will happen if we do not cull the roaming packs! Your map, if I may. Right...there, those are the points our scouts marked for patrol. I'll leave you to it, old girl. Come, Honoroit─I must return to my rounds!

Honoroit

-- Oh dear...do be careful, my lady.

Emmanellain

-- Luna Kali, Wolves' Bane! It pleases me to inform you that I have completed my rounds, and that all is well in Falcon's Nest. Oh, and there was a grizzled fellow looking for you. You know, the one who made that arsonist confess. Clever, that. Thancred, was it? He was asking after you. Anyway, once I noticed the garish weapons he was sporting, I deemed it a waste to leave him be. I dispatched him to an area I neglected to mark on your map...yes, this one. If you hurry, he might still be there.

-- I suppose we could simply wait here for your friend to return. But, if you're feeling impatient, you are free to go and look for him.

Honoroit

-- Terrible imposition though it was, I am relieved that my lord did not think to tend to the wolves by himself.

Hopeful Heretic

-- Stay your weapons! We come in peace! Lady Iceheart told us tales of Vidofnir. If she would trust in Ser Aymeric, then we too would hear what he has to say. But the wolves caught us unawares, and were it not for this man, we would have surely died.

Thancred

-- Fancy meeting you here, Luna. 'Twas fortunate I came when I did. These two would not have fared well against the wolves on their own. The young lord wasted no time taking advantage of you, did he? And me, I suppose. Let us return to Falcon's Nest, then, and see what other thrilling tasks he may have for us.

-- (It's always the younger one. Every time, without fail.)

Honoroit

-- How wonderful, you found Master Thancred! As ever, I could not help but fear the worst.

Emmanellain

-- And there they are, a pair of gallant heroes if I ever saw them. Comrades-in-arms, reunited at last. By your selfless sacrifice have you guaranteed the safety of our many guests. On behalf of Ishgard, I thank you both. And with that, there is naught left to do but to enjoy our well-earned respite.

Honoroit

-- (I am sorry, my lady. Truly, I am...)

Thancred

-- (“Selfless sacrifice” indeed.)

Old habits are hard to break, as Emmanellain soon proves. Upon realizing that his brother asked you to look after him, the young lord proceeds to press you into duty, bidding you patrol several locations outside Falcon's Nest where wolves have been sighted. Before you can voice your opinion on the matter, Emmanellain vanishes, leaving you with little choice but to carry out the menial task.

As expected, there were wolves, and as expected, they were no match for you. With luck, Emmanellain will have returned to his post by now.

After congratulating you on a job well done, Emmanellain proudly announces that he has completed his rounds of Falcon's Nest and that yes, all is indeed well. In passing, he mentions that he spoke with Thancred─or the “grizzled fellow” who “made that arsonist confess,” as he puts it─while you were away, and that he employed the same devious techniques on him that he used to press you into wolf-slaying duty. With a sigh, you turn your attention to the wastes outside Falcon's Nest once more.

You find Thancred, as well as two heretics he seemingly saved from a ravenous wolf pack. Together, you return to Falcon's Nest, eager to see what other thrilling tasks Lord Emmanellain has in store.

Emmanellain has only praise for you and Thancred. “Gallant heroes” by whose “selfless sacrifice” the safety of the conference's guests has been guaranteed. Flattering as his words are, you cannot help but sense a mocking edge, and you suspect Thancred does as well, given the grinding of his teeth.
