-- Commander Boleiden is eager to put you to work.

Bloeidin

-- So our friendly neighbors in U'Ghamaro have got much more aggressive of late, just as you said. Matter of fact, our scouts spotted one sniffin' about the stores just now, likely lookin' to make off with an armful of crystals. I'll be damned if I'm about to let that happen! Lend a hand and help us search the camp for the little bugger, would you?

-- Well? What are you waiting for!? We can't go lettin' thievin' bloody kobolds waltz into our camp and take whatever they fancy!

Alisaie

-- You've spoken with the commander, then?

Alphinaud

-- Our Maelstrom friends seem notably more agitated than when first we arrived. Do you happen to know why that might be?

-- A kobold in the camp, you say...? That would appear to corroborate Urianger's information, yes. But to be so reckless as to infiltrate a Maelstrom camp and draw attention to their efforts is passing strange. Well, there will be time to think on this later. For the present, we must do everything in our power to prevent Titan's summoning─and that means finding and questioning this kobold.

Alisaie

-- One of the scouts said he looked quite small for a kobold. Could he be hiding somewhere like this?

Alphinaud

-- Surely all this commotion cannot have escaped the kobold's notice. If he has any sense, he will attempt to quit this place, will he not?

Koboldling

-- S-Stay back! Away, far, back! I'm n-not a...not a... Gah, it's no use! Pointless, hopeless, no use!

-- P-P-Please, d-don't hurt me! I only wish to talk. Yes, yes, just talk...

Koboldling

-- This was a stupid plan! Stupid, stupid, stupid! But...if I tell no one, then everyone will... Gah, she found me again! What to do, what to do, what to do...?

-- I...I come in peace, only to talk! Speak, say, talk! So please, please, do not hurt me!

Alphinaud

-- So this is our wily kobold infiltrator, is it? No wonder the soldiers were on edge. He could very well give one a bruised knee.

Bloeidin

-- Huzzah, we've got him! Fine work, Scions!

-- So, little one─thought you could sneak into my camp, did you? Plottin' to steal my crystals, were you!?

Koboldling

-- No, no, no! I came to talk! To ask for help! But when your soldiers saw me, they drew their weapons and shouted, and I...I─

Alphinaud

-- Now, now, let us all take a deep breath and discuss this like civilized...individuals. What is your name, child?

Ga Bu

-- Pickman Ga Bu of the 620th Order! At least...I will be a pickman...one day.

Alphinaud

-- Well met, Ga Bu. I am Alphinaud, and this is my sister Alisaie. Luna, the woman who found you, is our friend. And now that you know our names, we can be friends too. Now, Commander Bloeidin here thinks you wanted to take his crystals, Ga Bu, but you said you came to ask for help. Why to us, and not to your own people? What happened, Ga Bu? Can you tell us?

Ga Bu

-- I...um...er...

Alisaie

-- No one is going to hurt you, all right? Not while we're here. I promise.

Ga Bu

-- Th-The... The patriarch, he...he's... <gulp> ...The patriarch is going to summon the Great Father again, and you have to stop him! Beat him, fight him, stop him! Ga Bu's parents said they didn't want it, along with many others! But the patriarch wouldn't listen. He was so angry─raging, fuming, angry! He said that if they didn't have iron in their hearts, they would serve as coke for the furnace. And then the guards took my parents and the others away, and I haven't seen any of them since...

Alphinaud

-- "Coke for the furnace“?

-- I did not want to believe it...but I have heard tales of foci fashioned from the bones of beastmen, which worshipers use in their rituals, hoping to summon more powerful incarnations of their gods. By the Twelve... That is... That is sickening.

Ga Bu

-- o one listens to Ga Bu, no matter how much he cries─pleads, begs, cries! They do not listen, only talk about punishing the overdwellers and praising the Great Father. Ga Bu loves the Great Father, but he loves his parents too! So please, help Ga Bu stop the patriarch and save his parents!

Alphinaud

-- Commander─advise Maelstrom Command that Titan's summoning is imminent. Should the worst come to the worst, we will require their support.

-- Time being of the essence, we three will attempt to infiltrate the kobold stronghold, secure their crystals, and free the prisoners.

Bloeidin

-- Well, if you're sure... You'll forgive me if I don't seem optimistic. We'll make ready, just in case.

Alisaie

-- Do you know that there are collectors who will pay a fortune for beastmen ritual artifacts? It is perverse.

Ga Bu

-- I tried talking to the others, but they wouldn't listen! So even though I was afraid, I came here!

Bloeidin

-- I'll leave it to you lot for now, but at the first sign of trouble, I'm sendin' in the Swallows. Understood?

Alphinaud

-- I have faith that we may yet stop the ritual. We would surely have detected the associated aetheric disturbance had Titan manifested already. But I cannot speak for the prisoners. Twelve have mercy... That they would even contemplate sacrificing their own flesh and blood─brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers...

-- Time is of the essence. We must see what else Ga Bu knows and formulate a plan without further delay.

Alisaie

-- What sort of twisted monster would consider a ritual focus a work of art, knowing full well how it was made? And we call them beastmen.

Alphinaud

-- Let us pray that we still have time to save Ga Bu's parents...

Commander Bloeidin confirms Urianger's report that the kobolds of U'Ghamaro have grown more aggressive of late. Of more immediate concern, however, is the fact that one of the beastmen may be skulking about the camp, possibly with designs on the crystal store. Perhaps with the aid of Alphinaud and Alisaie, you can sniff out this mysterious infiltrator.

Though Alphinaud readily acknowledges that the kobolds' recent behavior does suggest that a summoning is imminent, he finds it odd that a single kobold would wander so close to a Maelstrom camp and risk drawing attention to the efforts of his brethren. Nevertheless, the beastman's presence presents a valuable opportunity to learn more of the kobolds' plans─providing he can be taken alive, of course.

The curiously small kobold proves quite easy to find, but difficult to catch, darting away after sensing your approach. However, in his panicked, disoriented state, he surely cannot have gone far.

Sure enough, you come upon the young kobold hiding beneath the wooden stairs to the east of the camp. This time, he begins to make a half-hearted appeal for you to keep your distance, but overcome by fear, stops short and flees once more.

You catch up with the kobold yet again, who─yet again─manages only a handful of words before running away. With a sigh, you resume your pursuit, offering a silent prayer that his little legs will grow weary before your own.

Blessedly, the kobold does not attempt to escape a fourth time, having mustered the courage to stand his ground and plead his case. Joined by Alphinaud, Alisaie, and Commander Bloeidin, you listen as he introduces himself as Ga Bu of the 620th Order. The young child then reveals his reason for coming to Camp Overlook: to beseech the Maelstrom to stop the patriarch from summoning Great Father Titan. Ga Bu goes on to explain that his parents, along with other like-minded kobolds, spoke out against the patriarch's plans, only to be taken away to serve as “coke for the furnace.” This ominous turn of phrase prompts Alisaie to recall tales of beastmen fashioning ritual foci from the bones of their brethren as a means to summon more powerful incarnations of their gods. Fearing the worst, Alphinaud instructs the commander to inform Maelstrom Command that Titan's return may be imminent, and declares that the Scions will attempt to infiltrate the kobold stronghold, secure the crystals, and free the prisoners.

Lowering his voice, Alphinaud confesses that although he is confident the primal has yet to be summoned, it may yet be too late to save Ga Bu's parents and the other prisoners. Regardless, you must do all you can to stop the patriarch's plans, and for that you will need to enlist the help of the brave young kobold before you.

# The Beast That Mourned at the Heart of the Mountain

```plaintext
System Guide

-- Shifting nervously from foot to foot, Ga Bu struggles to meet your gaze...

Ga Bu

-- I heard Great Father Titan loves crystals. Cherishes, covets, loves them, and if we gather enough, He will return. That's why the patriarch told everyone to go forth and gather them. So I was thinking, if we take all the crystals away, maybe the Great Father won't come?

Alphinaud

-- Very good, Ga Bu. I was just thinking the same thing. Do you know where these crystals are stored?

Ga Bu

-- I know, I know, oh, oh, oh! Several spots, each defended by a different order! Ga Bu wanted to steal them, but he was too afraid to go alone. Yes, yes, too afraid to go alone. But together we can take them away and hide them! Come, come─Ga Bu will lead you to the first cache!

Alisaie

-- That hardly seemed fair. Then again, they only have themselves to blame.

Alphinaud

-- Pray see to the crystals. Alisaie and I will stand guard for any errant patrols.

Ga Bu

-- Quickly, quickly!

Alphinaud

-- Do you have them all? Good. Lead on, Ga Bu.

Ga Bu

-- This way, this way!

Alisaie

-- What are you waiting for? We stand lookout─you take the crystals!

Alphinaud

-- Hmm... If I did not know any better, I would say this crate was...

Ga Bu

-- If they find us, you'll protect me, won't you?

Alisaie

-- Time is short. If you have the crystals, we should move on to the next cache.

-- Did you hear me, Brother? Brother!

Alphinaud

-- Aye, aye, it's just that... I am quite certain that crate once bore Ishgardian seals. Someone took great pains to remove all traces, but enough remains to make out the pattern. See for yourself. I struggle to imagine kobolds traveling to Coerthas to obtain crystals, much less bothering to conceal their origins. I suspect these crystals were smuggled into Vylbrand by another party─most likely a pawn of the Ascians, as Thancred speculated.

```plaintext
Ga Bu

-- I don't understand. Who are the Ascians? Do they worship Great Father Titan too?

Alphinaud

-- Ah, never you mind about that. As Alisaie said, we do not have a lot of time. Can you lead us to the next cache, Ga Bu?

Ga Bu

-- Yes, yes, yes, of course! Ga Bu knows the way!

-- This next one is the last and is very large! Very big, very huge, very large!

Alphinaud

-- Ga Bu said the cache would be here, but unless it is remarkably well hidden...

Alisaie

-- We should pack up the crystals and leave─now. The kobolds could stumble upon our handiwork at any moment.

Ga Bu

-- B-B-But they were here! Heaps and heaps and heaps of crystals!

System

-- Though you cast about for a time, you see no sign of the crystals...

Alphinaud

-- Confound it. What about you, Luna? Any luck?

Ga Bu

-- Nothing, nothing, nothing! But this cannot be! Ga Bu saw them! Spied, spotted, saw!

Alisaie

-- Think, Brother, think! They must have moved them, yes? The question is, where to, and why?

Alphinaud

-- ...Within O'Ghomoro, where they summoned Titan once before and mean to do so again. It is the only explanation.

Ga Bu

-- What about Mother and Father and the others!? We have to help them!

Alisaie

-- And we will, Ga Bu, we will! Stay calm─we still have time.

Alphinaud

-- They have yet to call for the remaining crates, yes? If they had, then they would have found the other caches empty and sounded the alarum. Nevertheless, I believe the time for stealth has passed. We must breach the Navel and seize the remaining crystals. There is no other way to prevent Titan's summoning. But first, give me your crystals, that I might deliver them into Commander Bloeidin's custody. We dare not take them into the bowels of the mountain.

Alisaie

-- Alphinaud is right. 'Twould be folly to deliver the kobolds the very thing we sought to deny them.

Ga Bu

-- Mother, Father, we're coming...

Cache of Crystals (Item)

-- A large quantity of crystals intended for Titan's summoning.

Alphinaud

-- The crystals, Luna, if you would be so kind.

-- Thank you. I shall deliver them to Camp Overlook for safekeeping and brief Commander Bloeidin on the situation. Pray go on ahead. As I recall, there is an aetheryte within the U'Ghamaro Mines that should deliver you to the Navel. Ga Bu doubtless knows the way. Wait for me there─I shall rejoin you anon.

Alisaie

-- Strange─I would've thought you eager to remain in the thick of the action. But if this is what you would prefer, then godsspeed, Brother.

Ga Bu

-- This way, this way!
```

>> Strange─I would've thought you eager to remain in <u>the thick</u> of the action.

Ga Bu

-- I hope the patriarch and my parents are there...

Alisaie

-- Ah. I take it this is the aetheryte we seek? Right then. As soon as Alphinaud arrives, we go. I trust you're feeling suitably heroic, Luna--there's no telling what sort of resistance we'll face in there.

2nd Order Patriach Za Da

-- Quickly, you clods! Briskly, swiftly, quickly! I will not suffer any further delays!

Alphinaud

-- Lay down your arms and surrender! We have your crystals. There will be no summoning this day!

2nd Order Patriach Za Da

-- Overdwellers!? Here!? But how did you─

Ga Bu

-- Where are my parents, Patriarch!? Where are they!?

-- Mother...? Father...

Alisaie

-- "Coke for the furnace“? You monster. How could you!?

2nd Order Patriach Za Da

-- I... We are but servants of the Lord of Crags. We are His, that He may drink of our blood and partake of our flesh─that He might draw upon the strength of His children and defend them from the tyranny of the overdwellers!

Alphinaud

-- No, Alisaie. Not yet.

-- I understand, Patriarch. I do. Your fear, your anger, your hate... You would do anything to protect your people─anything to deliver them from despair. Whatever it takes to ensure that those who threaten you can never do so again. But in your single-minded pursuit of this objective, you have brought suffering on your own kith and kin. You have sacrificed the lives of the very people you sought to protect! But it need not be this way, Patriarch! Renounce this bloody course! Cease your attempts to summon your god, and work with us, together, to build a lasting peace!

2nd Order Patriach Za Da

-- Another peace to be abandoned at the overdwellers' convenience! Oathbreakers, all of you! Liars, betrayers, oathbreakers! You take and you take and you take, and when you have had your fill, you sue for peace. You promise that this time, this time is the last─until you grow hungry again! And when we dare to defend ourselves, you declare that this “beast tribe” cannot be suffered to live! That our god drains the land of aether, and brings naught but suffering─death, destruction, suffering upon us all! I will hear no more lies from you and yours, overdweller! You've ruined your own lands─you'll not ruin ours!

Ga Bu

-- I said I'd come for you, and I did! I'm here...I'm here...I'm here... Say something, please. Please...

-- PLEEEAAASE!!!

Wake up... Wake up...
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
wake up wake up─
WAAAKE UUUUUUP!!!

Alphinaud

-- Seven hells!

-- We must away!

```plaintext
Alisaie

-- He's breathing, and I don't see any injuries, but I can't seem to wake him...

Alphinaud

-- By the Twelve, how could I be so foolish? I should have known better than to let Ga Bu accompany us, given what we were like to find. His anguish and despair have served to birth a primal, just as surely as would the supplications of the faithful. Worse, being born of such tumultuous emotion, this incarnation of Titan seems incapable of naught but violence. If we have one cause for optimism, it is that while many crystals were present, they represented but a fraction of the quantity intended for the summoning ritual. ...Meaning that Titan must be far weaker than planned.

-- Be that as it may, he is yet a primal, and the longer we leave him to bleed the land of aether, the stronger he will grow. And should Titan be permitted to leave O'Ghomoro, more lives will be lost. The Maelstrom will rally their troops, and the cycle will continue. Luna, you know what must be done. Will you face the Lord of Crags once more?

-- Thank you, my friend. Alisaie and I will tend to Ga Bu. When you have finished with the primal, look for us in Camp Overlook. We will be expecting you.

Alisaie

-- Fight well, Luna. Fight well...

Alphinaud

-- I have faith that you will return to us, just as you always have.

Alisaie

-- You're back! Gods, what a relief...

Alphinaud

-- Ah, there she is! Did I not tell you she would return safe and sound?

-- The deed is done, then? Titan is no more? Good. There has been enough tragedy this day.

-- He has been like that since he regained consciousness. We believe he can hear us, but he has made no attempt to respond. He is almost certainly still in shock, but... But we cannot discount the possibility that he succumbed to the primal's influence. Should that prove to be the case─He must be put to death, like any other thrall. Such is the Alliance's policy, yes?

Alisaie

-- He must be put to death, like any other thrall. Such is the Alliance's policy, yes?

Alphinaud

-- ...You have the right of it. But we must not rush to conclusions. After all, we once feared that Ysayle's followers were beyond reason, and many have since laid down their arms and accepted Ishgard's peace.

Alisaie

-- ...We can but watch, wait, and pray.

Alisaie

-- I know what happened. Gods help me, I was there. But the thought that we might have to... Seven hells, he's just a child!

Great minds think alike, and both Alphinaud and Ga Bu conclude that stealing the kobolds' crystals may offer the best hope of preventing Titan's summoning. The child proudly declares that he knows where the crystals are stored, and charges off towards U'Ghamaro, eager to guide you and the twins to the first cache.

Alphinaud and Alisaie make short work of the kobold sentries, leaving you to secure the crystals while they stand guard. Though the beastmen appear to be unaware of your presence for now, there is no telling when a patrol may stumble upon you and sound the alarum.

You pack up the crystals and signal your readiness to move on. Ga Bu duly shouts for you to follow him deeper into U'Ghamaro, and you and the twins give chase, albeit rather more cautiously.

After shoveling the contents of the second cache into your pack, you and Alisaie turn to Ga Bu and prepare to press on. Alphinaud, however, lingers for a moment, crouching over the now empty crate with a puzzled expression on his face. Rising at length, he states that the container once bore Ishgardian seals, which someone took great pains to remove. Reasoning that the kobolds would not journey to Aldenard to obtain crystals, much less bother with such precautions, he deduces that the crate must have been smuggled out of Ishgard and transported across the sea─likely at the behest of the Ascians. Alas, there is no time to dwell on the implications of this discovery as the third cache of crystals awaits.

Ga Bu leads you to what he believes to be the location of the third cache, only to find that there is nothing there. A thorough survey of the area serves to confirm your suspicions: the crystals have been moved. Alphinaud can only assume that they are now deep within O'Ghomoro, at the site of the summoning ritual. That being the case, you have no recourse but to breach the Navel once more and seize the remaining crystals by force. Before you launch your attack, however, Alphinaud insists that you hand over the crystals in your pack, reasoning that it would be reckless to take them with you into the enemy's midst.

With the crystals in his possession, Alphinaud departs for Camp Overlook, promising to return after warning the Maelstrom forces to prepare for the worst. Together with Alisaie and Ga Bu, you continue onward into the U'Ghamaro Mines, towards the beastman aetheryte which will deliver you into the heart of the mountain.

Having been rejoined by Alphinaud, you all teleport into the Navel and order the kobold patriarch and his minions to surrender. Ga Bu duly demands to see his parents, but realizes to his horror that you have arrived too late, and that they and the other prisoners have already been executed. Even as Alphinaud makes a final attempt to reason with the patriarch, the kobold child cries out over and over again for his parents to wake up, his wailing filling the chamber, growing louder, more intense─and then, as if in answer, the gathered crystals begin to glow. Moments later, the aether begins to coalesce, dragging the rocks towards a single point, until the Lord of Crags stands before you in all his terrible fury. With a mixture of joy and confusion, the kobolds look on their Great Father, who fixes them with his burning gaze...before casting them from the platform in a fit of rage. You and Alisaie move to defend the distraught Ga Bu while Alphinaud conjures a Carbuncle to distract the raging primal, and as Titan claws at his face, the four of you make your escape.

As Alisaie tends to Ga Bu, who remains unconscious following his ordeal, you and Alphinaud discuss how best to proceed. While summoned with far fewer crystals than intended, the Titan born of the child's anguish is nevertheless a threat which cannot be ignored, for he will only grow stronger as he draws aether from the land. And so it falls to you to return to the Navel, and there put the rampaging avatar of grief out of its misery.

As the primal's form gradually fades from existence, his final despairing pleas echo in your ears. Though justifiably relieved, the shadow of the tragedy which granted him life yet looms large in your thoughts, and you know not how to feel. Nevertheless, Titan is no more, and you are free to return to Camp Overlook and the others.

Although Ga Bu has at last awakened from his torpor, the child has spoken nary a word. With great trepidation, Alphinaud gives voice to the unhappy possibility that Ga Bu may have fallen prey to the primal's influence. Should that prove to be the case, you will have no choice but to surrender him to the Maelstrom for summary execution. For the time being, however, you can but watch, wait, and pray that he recovers.
