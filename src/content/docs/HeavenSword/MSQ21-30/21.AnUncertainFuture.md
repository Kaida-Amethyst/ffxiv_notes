-- Alphinaud wishes to share the latest developments in the search for he missing Scions.

Alphinaud

-- Fortuitous timing as always, Luna. Tataru was about to brief me on the search for our missing comrades.

-- If you would be so kind, then?

Tataru

-- Absolutely! You'll be pleased to hear that Riol and his men have been making excellent progress! You remember how F'lhaminn helped me to escape the Crystal Braves in Limsa Lominsa, only to then disappear? Well, according to Riol, she crept aboard a ship bound for Radz-at-Han, where she's been hiding ever since. He assures me that it won't be long before we're reunited. As for Yda and Papalymo, the remains of their linkpearls have been found‚îÄand in Pearl Lane of all places. Riol thinks they must have disposed of them after escaping from the Royal Promenade.

Alphinaud

-- Yes, that would make sense... They could not risk being eavesdropped upon by our betrayers.

Tataru

-- We're all but certain they fled the city shortly after...though we still don't have a clue where they went.

Alphinaud

-- I see. And what of Thancred and Minfilia?

Tataru

-- ...I'm afraid I have nothing new to share about those two. But it's not all doom and gloom! The good news is, we've enlisted the services of a Sharlayan scholar‚îÄone of the Students of Baldesion‚îÄto aid in the search, who should be arriving any day now!

Alphinaud

-- One of the Students, you say? I should very much like to meet this scholar‚îÄif time permits.

-- But first we must attend to a more pressing matter. Ser Aymeric has summoned the two of us for a private audience. The messenger did not specify what he wished to discuss‚îÄonly that it was urgent. Assuming you have no objections, Luna, I suggest we proceed to the Congregation forthwith. And mayhap we can meet with the scholar afterwards. Agreed?

Tataru

-- In that case, I think I'll return to the Forgotten Knight for now. Things are liable to fall apart if I'm gone too long, you know!

----------------------

Tataru

-- Don't worry about our visitor. Y'shtola and I will treat her to a warm welcome!

Alphinaud

-- Good invariably triumphs over evil in faerie tales, yet they are conspicuously reticent about what follows...

Temple Knight Guard

-- The lord commander is within. Pray proceed, miss.

Aymeric

-- Thank you for coming. I wished to speak with you both in a place where privacy was assured.

Alphinaud

-- We quite understand. What was it that you wished to discuss?

Aymeric

-- With my father's passing, the seat of the archbishop lies vacant. And so, in accordance with canon law, I have assumed his responsibilities. I should stress that this is a temporary measure. It was never intended that the lord commander of the Temple Knights serve in this capacity indefinitely. Quite the opposite. The statutes specify that I should surrender my powers as soon as a conclave of the senior clergy and the High Houses have named a new archbishop. But in light of recent events, that would not seem appropriate.

Alphinaud

-- I confess, I did not expect you to divulge quite so much quite so soon. The details of the archbishop's plans, perhaps...but the true origin of the war and all it entails...?

Aymeric

-- I too had concerns. But when the Warrior of Light is witnessed returning to the capital upon the back of a dragon, one's options are rather limited. Mayhap I could have concealed certain details...but for how long? And at what risk? Should the truth have come to light in the meantime, how would the people have viewed my silence? After a thousand years of lies and secrecy, I could not well abuse their trust and hope to be believed. The time for deception has passed. ...I only wish the people agreed. That some would deny the truth, I had anticipated‚îÄbut not this many. And among the few who acknowledge that my father had to be stopped, no small number question our methods.

Alphinaud

-- If they suspect a coup, it will not be long before some turn to violence.

Lucia

-- It has already begun--and that on both sides. Men and women of the cloth are being harassed in the streets. Some have even been assaulted in the Brume. Hilda and her people have formed a watch to help us maintain order, but such measures will not prevent the unrest from spreading.

Aymeric

-- For all our talk of peace, the people remain frightened and confused. For their sake, we must bring the Dragonsong War to a definitive end.

Alphinaud

-- And we should be glad to help you, Ser Aymeric. But what precisely would you have us do?

Lucia

-- We wish to treat with the dragons of Anyx Trine. To that end, I would trouble you for an escort and an introduction.

Alphinaud

-- Anyx Trine? ...You would speak with Vidofnir, then?

Aymeric

-- We must needs open a dialogue between our peoples. Acting as my representative, Lucia will extend an invitation to their leader, that she might visit us here in Ishgard. Were she still with us, I would of course have beseeched Ysayle's assistance in this matter. But as she is not, I must ask that you aid us in her stead. Will you do us this favor?

-- Thank you, my friends.

-- Lucia‚îÄI leave the rest to you.

In the wake of the archbishop's fall, the nation of Ishgard trembled, the faith of her people shaken to its very core. For a thousand years had they fought and died, certain of the justice of their cause, only to be told that their holy war was born of the sins of their forefathers. What then, for those brave men and women, thus stripped of their righteousness, but to despair? To deny the truth and decry its speakers? And what then for those whom they defamed but to hope on? To have faith in a brighter tomorrow? A tomorrow in which man and dragon might live together in harmony‚îÄthen as distant as the very stars in the heavens...

Yet while we dared to hope, deep within his lair, the enemy lay gathering his strength. Nidhogg, now possessed of his two eyes and the body of the Azure Dragoon‚îÄprizes to which he had laid claim at the very hour of the heroes' triumph. As desperately as we sought the solace of peace, the great wyrm craved the misery of war. Nor was he alone in this misbegotten desire...

Alpninaud

-- The journey, at least, should pose little difficulty this time.

Lucia

-- I know little of the lands these dragons call home‚îÄthis Anyx Trine. Had you not agreed to escort me, the coming journey would seem a far more daunting prospect. 

Alphinaud

-- I confess, I myself once shuddered at the thought of it. Yet even the longest journey begins with the first step, does it not? Ah, but ere we set forth, Luna and I must needs inform our comrade of our plans.

Lucia

-- Very well. I shall see to my preparations.

Alphinaud

-- Then let us go and bid farewell to Tataru, Luna.

Lucia

-- Traversing the western highlands calls for warmer clothing. Yet there are only so many layers one can fit under plate armor...

Symme

Alphinaud

-- Hm? I thought you might want to tell her. Or would you rather I did all the talking...?

Tataru

-- So? What was your secret meeting all about? I'm all ears!

-- A diplomatic mission to Anyx Trine, you say? Well, I suppose that does take precedence... But should your meeting with Vidofnir happen to end early, you might consider rendezvousing with Y'shtola in Idyllshire. She'll be there to receive our guest. Don't get me wrong, your meeting with the dragons is terribly important and everything, but this scholar just happens to be‚îÄ

Alphinaud

-- Time permitting, as I said. We shall endeavor to join Y'shtola, but if we cannot, pray pass on our regards. Let us be off, Luna. We have kept the first commander waiting long enough.

Tataru

-- <sigh> Well, let no one say I didn't try!

Alphinaud

-- One task at a time, Luna. Besides, I have no doubt that Y'shtola can look after the scholar by herself.

Lucia

-- You are ready, then? Good‚îÄso am I.

Although there has been progress in the search for F'lhaminn, Yda, and Papalymo, the hunt for Minfilia and Thancred remains at a standstill. Fortunately, it would seem that one of the surviving Students of Baldesion is coming to aid you in your efforts. As much as he would like to stay and greet the Sharlayan scholar, Alphinaud‚îÄand you‚îÄhave been summoned for a private audience with Ser Aymeric to discuss an undisclosed matter. Attend the lord commander at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly forthwith.

Despite Ser Aymeric's decision to disclose the circumstances surrounding his father's disappearance, there is growing unrest in the city of Ishgard. Some dispute the lord commander's version of events, while many who do accept the truth question the measures taken to stop the archbishop. Still others have turned their ire on the clergy whom they claim were complicit in Thordan's deception. Desperate to secure a lasting peace, Ser Aymeric bids you escort Lucia to Anyx Trine, that she might treat with Vidofnir and thereby reestablish diplomatic relations with Hraesvelgr's brood.

Lucia admits to knowing little of Anyx Trine or its surrounding lands, and thanks you for agreeing to serve as her escort. As it may be some time before you return to the capital, Alphinaud thinks it best to notify Tataru of your plans prior to departing.

Tataru is heartened to learn of your diplomatic mission, and readily concedes that it should take precedence over receiving the Sharlayan scholar. Even so, she encourages you to join the welcoming party in Idyllshire should time permit, as the Sharlayan scholar in question is not just anyone... Before she can elaborate, however, Alphinaud loudly declares that you must return to the Congregation at once. Apparently, the first commander has been kept waiting long enough.

Lucia has finished her preparations and is eager to depart. With luck, this will be a momentous journey...

## Breaking the Cycle

<div class="border-4 p-6">
System Guide

-- Alphinaud is ready to escort Lucia to Anyx Trine.

Alphinaud

-- The path is long but known to us. From Falcon's Nest, we shall cross the western highlands and make for Tailfeather in the Dravanian forelands. There we can stop to rest and replenish our supplies. Questions? If not, then the stables await.

Alphinaud

-- Strange... This is only my third visit to Tailfeather, yet the first feels as though it were a lifetime ago.

Lucia

-- I always imagined that the first time I set foot upon Dravanian soil would be at the head of an army. And here I am, ready to treat with the brothers and sisters of mine enemies.

Alphinaud

-- Full well do I know how difficult it can be to set aside the past. Though it was I who first proposed recruiting Ysayle to our cause, I questioned the wisdom of my words almost as soon as I had uttered them...and for a long time after that. Here was a woman with the blood of innocents on her hands. Men, women, children‚îÄall slain in the name of the implacable Lady Iceheart. Yet she acknowledged her misdeeds and agreed to join us in common cause. At our side, she fought in service to that greater good...even unto her dying breath‚îÄand while that does not absolve her of her sins, I...I hope that one day she will be remembered not merely as a heretic, but as a misguided soul who dreamt of peace.

Lucia

-- ...You ask much, Master Alphinaud. Yet who can say what might come to pass...should our negotiations bear fruit.

Alphinaud

-- Yes‚îÄyes, of course. We must press on to Anyx Trine. If you will follow me...

Vidofnir

-- Thou art ever welcome here, friend of Ysayle. But this one I do not know.

Alphinaud

-- Pray forgive us this unannounced visit, Vidofnir. May I present to you Lucia, first commander of the Temple Knights of Ishgard‚îÄand our trusted friend.

Lucia

-- It is an honor to meet you, Vidofnir. I am come as an envoy of Ser Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights and acting leader of the Holy See.

Vidofnir

-- Indeed. You may speak, knight.

Lucia

-- For one thousand years, man and dragon have been locked in an endless cycle of bloodshed and sorrow. To our shame, we long believed your kin to be the architects of this war. But now we know the truth: that King Thordan and his knights twelve did willfully betray and murder the great wyrm Ratatoskr, shattering the peace between our peoples. For one thousand years, our leaders conspired to conceal this truth‚îÄa truth which was at last laid bare by the Warrior of Light, the Azure Dragoon...and Ysayle. Alas, a deception so intricately wrought cannot be undone in a moment, and our people labor to accept the truth. After an eternity of war, who would dare to dream that peace could at last be within our grasp? Yet dream we must, as Ysayle once did. And we must make that dream a reality, as she could not. We humbly beseech you, Vidofnir: join hands with us in friendship once more, before the eyes of my people, in Ishgard.

Vidofnir

-- ...A most unexpected invitation. I have heard your request, knight. However, I cannot yet give you mine answer.

Lucia

-- May I ask why?

Vidofnir

-- This matter concerneth my sire. He must needs be consulted. Moreover, the Gnath grow bold, even as they did before, and I would not leave my people at the mercy of the swarm.

Lucia

-- Then we will wait. After a thousand years at war, we shall not give up on peace for want of patience.

Vidofnir

-- Ha! Fear not, knight: thou shalt have mine answer within thy lifetime.

Lucia

-- So soon? My humble thanks. I shall bear your words to my lord forthwith. Until we meet again.

Vidofnir

-- Never did I think to see a knight of Ishgard come unto Anyx Trine bearing words instead of steel... Would that the Gnath could show the same restraint. Too many children have fallen to their spears and muskets.

Lucia

-- To face such a creature in battle is one thing, to converse with it quite another...

Alphinaud

-- Given the circumstances, I would say that went rather well.

Lucia

-- To be frank, I am surprised our proposal was not rejected outright. Whether aught will come of it remains to be seen, however... Mayhap I should take this opportunity to speak with some of the other dragons... Ah, but you need not wait for me. The return journey holds no fears for me now.

Alphinaud

-- Well, if you have no further need of our services, we shall continue on to Sharlayan. We hope to welcome a scholar who has agreed to aid us in the search for our missing comrades.

Lucia

-- Then I pray your journey is as swift and uneventful as ours was, and thank you again for sparing the time to assist us, even when such grave matters remain unresolved.

Alphinaud

-- I can think of no graver matter than a thousand-year war‚îÄone which our friends gave their lives to see ended. Suffice it to say, I would willingly make a thousand such journeys to ensure that their sacrifice was not in vain.

Lucia

-- Of that I have no doubt, Master Alphinaud. I only hope the fates will not hold you to your word.

-- (Talking with a small dragon)...Beg pardon? My favorite food? Well...I am fond of omelettes. Dodo egg omelettes.

Alphinaud explains to Lucia that the first leg of your journey will take you from Falcon's Nest to Tailfeather, where you may stop to rest and replenish supplies. Set forth without further ado.

It is said that war makes soldiers of us all‚îÄbut what peace makes of soldiers is less clear. Though Lucia understands the importance of her mission, it is plain that the thought of treating with the brothers and sisters of her enemies still sits ill with her. Alphinaud too has struggled to reconcile his preconceptions in the past, particularly in relation to Ysayle, whom he once viewed as a murderous fanatic, but later came to see as a noble, if misguided, soul. Perhaps, one day, others will share his opinion...

Vidofnir greets Lucia rather coolly, but agrees to hear Ser Aymeric's proposal nonetheless. She duly listens as the knight speaks of the Ishgardians' ancient sin, and of the dream that Ysayle held dear, which Ser Aymeric hopes may yet be made reality. Though the dragon's subsequent response is disappointingly noncommittal, you sense that, in her heart of hearts, she harbors the same hope.

While it remains to be seen if your diplomatic efforts will bear fruit, your companions agree that the meeting went as well as could be expected, given the circumstances. Your business in Anyx Trine thus concluded, you bid farewell to Lucia so that you may continue west to Sharlayan and join Y'shtola in welcoming the visiting scholar.

Alphinaud

-- So...it would seem we have time to greet this scholar after all. How delightful. I shall be interested to hear how she means to go about finding Minfilia and Thancred. I can only assume she is privy to some new investigative technique. In any event, our first order of business is to rendezvous with Y'shtola in Idyllshire.

Y'shtola

-- Ah, Luna‚îÄ'tis good to see you. I confess, I had assumed your business in Anyx Trine would detain you longer. Did your meeting with Vidofnir go well?

Alphinaud

-- As well as can be expected. She must discuss Ser Aymeric's proposal with Hraesvelgr, of course, but she seemed amenable to the suggestion. What of our Sharlayan guest? Has she arrived yet?

Y'shtola

-- She has, but when I explained that you would be joining us, she asked if she might use the intervening time to explore. I agreed to meet her outside on Frontbridge. We should be on our way.

Krile

-- I am terribly, terribly sorry to have kept you all waiting!

Y'shtola

-- You need not apologize. We arrived but a moment ago ourselves. Pray allow me to introduce Krile, who is recently come from the Sharlayan motherland. She has generously offered to assist us.

Krile

-- Oh please, think nothing of it! A trip to Eorzea was long overdue.

-- You must be the Warrior of Light. Yes...you certainly do look the part. A pleasure to meet you at last, miss.

-- And who is that I spy but young Alphinaud Leveilleur himself! I daresay someone's grown an ilm or two in my absence‚îÄor are those lifts in your boots?

Alphinaud

-- We, uh... Ahem. Miss Krile and I met at the Studium, years ago. I shall forever be indebted to her for her sage guidance.

Krile

-- It was no small task keeping him out of trouble, believe you me! The youngest ever to enter the Studium‚îÄhim and his sister, eleven-year-old prodigies. Suffice it to say, social graces were not among his list of talents! Striding up to his seniors on his first day, head held high‚îÄwhat was it he said again...?

Alphinaud

-- Thank you, Krile!

Krile

-- For what? I haven't finished yet. Would you care to attempt a more dextrous deflection?

Alphinaud

-- Ahem... Mayhap we should save this delightful conversation for a more fitting occasion, when pressing matters do not demand our undivided attention.

Krile

-- A bit much, but better. I can tell you have been putting your skills to use here in Eorzea. Henceforth, I trust you will dazzle me with your eloquence at the first time of asking.

-- Right. On to more pressing matters‚îÄfinding Minfilia and the other missing Scions!

Y'shtola

-- I gather you have new information to share with us?

Krile

-- A new approach, actually. Tataru recounted the tale of your escape, and it gave me an idea. Simply put, assuming Thancred left some manner of trail when you whisked him away‚îÄas is almost always the case with teleportation magicks‚îÄI am confident I can find and follow it.

Alphinaud

-- Then what are you waiting for!?

Krile

-- The wherewithal to do it. The fact is, my abilities aren't quite up to the task. Not in themselves, anyway. If I had Master Matoya's Crystal Eye, on the other hand...

Y'shtola

Alphinaud is curious to know how the Sharlayan scholar will help you to locate Minfilia and Thancred. Happily, all should be revealed soon enough.

After yet another remarkably uneventful journey, you rendezvous with Y'shtola, who informs you that the Sharlayan scholar arrived safely and is presently exploring the wilderness outside Idyllshire. She should be returning to Frontbridge at any moment‚îÄyou need but wait there to meet her.

The scholar is revealed to be none other than Krile, a dear friend of Minfilia. But that is not all. To your surprise‚îÄand Alphinaud's chagrin‚îÄyou learn that the woman also knew the Leveilleur twins during their time at the Studium. After sparing a moment to reminisce upon those halcyon days, she explains that she has a plan to locate Thancred.

Matoya

-- <sigh> Is that trouble I smell, or did you forget to wipe your boots on the way in?

Y'shtola

-- Forgive us, Master Matoya. We will be sure to wipe them on the way out. And may I say how glad I am that age has not yet deprived you of your senses.

Matoya

-- Ever so quick-witted, aren't we‚îÄto the detriment of your manners. Well, out with it then. What do you want?

Krile

-- Pray allow me to introduce myself, Master Matoya. I am Krile, of the Students of Baldesion. I hope you will excuse our unannounced visit.

Matoya

-- Baldesion, you say? Ah yes, the old coot set up shop on the Isle of Val, didn't he?

Krile

-- Regrettably, our order's headquarters‚îÄand the isle itself‚îÄwere obliterated by a magick of immense power. I have the blessing of Light to thank for my own preservation.

Alphinaud

-- Krile‚îÄyou too possess the Echo!?

Krile

-- Well yes, of course I do. Our order is devoted to uncovering the mysteries of Hydaelyn and interpreting Her will, particularly through the study of Her gift to us. It was in the course of these studies that I met and subsequently befriended Minfilia. She and I have rather a lot in common.

Alphinaud

-- I had no idea.

Krile

-- You weren't supposed to. Not that I wanted to deceive you, you understand, but precautions had to be taken.

Matoya

-- Yes, yes‚îÄthat's all well and good, but you still haven't told me why you're here.

Krile

-- The Students of Baldesion are gone, and there is naught I can do to change that. But the Scions of the Seventh Dawn can yet be restored and my dear friend found. You have in your possession an ancient Crystal of Light‚îÄone you call your ‚ÄúCrystal Eye.‚Äù I believe I can use it to focus my abilities and locate one of the missing Scions.

Matoya

-- And there I was thinking you might want to make use of my years of experience... <sigh> Wait here.

Y'shtola

-- Long did I ponder the nature of this crystal and its familiar radiance...but never did I suspect it was a Crystal of Light.

Krile

-- On the cusp of an Umbral Calamity, souls blessed with the power of the Echo invariably appear. To aid these Her chosen warriors, Hydaelyn bequeaths to each a sliver of Her strength in the form of a Crystal of Light. But as Her strength wanes, so too does the potency of Her gifts. This crystal, born of an earlier era, is infused with a power far greater than those of this age.

Matoya

-- You could travel the length and breadth of the land and not find a crystal even a fraction as pure. Its value is beyond measure‚îÄas are the risks inherent in its use.

Krile

-- No two manifestations of the Echo are alike. I, for example, can converse with beings of every shape and size‚îÄexcepting beasts, contrary to what others would have you believe. Language has nothing to do with it, of course; rather, I am sensitive to the whispers of the soul. Their intent, their very essence even‚îÄthe traces of which served to guide the elementals to Y'shtola. Far-fetched though it may sound, I believe that with your Crystal Eye, I may be able to pick up where they left off and follow the remaining trail to Thancred. That is, if I have your permission...?

Matoya

-- Well, the poor sod's not going to find himself. So, as long as you don't drop it or take it out of my sight, you may do with it what you will.

Krile

-- Thank you, Master Matoya!

-- Then let us begin.

-- From the Black Shroud, the trail continues to the north and west...towards a mountain...the foot of Sohm Al. It was a near thing, but he was not deposited within the rock. I think.

Alphinaud

-- The hunters of Tailfeather know those lands well. I say we begin our search there!

Matoya

-- No one ever comes around for tea anymore. No, it's always saving this, preventing that, or mending the godsforsaken other. Anyone would think I wasn't good company.

Y'shtola

-- Thancred may be a capable warrior, but he was wounded when last I saw him. If any beasts were nearby when he emerged from the Lifestream, he would have been hard-pressed to repel them.

Krile

-- We had forests like these on the Isle of Val. My grandfather and I used to go for walks together when I could prise him away from his work. It was the least I could do for him, considering everything he has done for me. Taking me in when I was an orphan, raising me as his own and giving me a name‚îÄyou didn't think my parents named me Krile Baldesion, did you?

Alphinaud

-- Were I to find myself in an unfamiliar wilderness, my first instinct would be to seek out signs of civilization.

Y'shtola

-- Ordinarily, perhaps, but in his wounded state, he may not have wished to risk contact with strangers of unknown allegiance. Yet even had Thancred chosen to remain in the forest, the hunters would surely have stumbled across his trail.

Krile

-- Tailfeather doesn't strike me as an isolated outpost, though. Merchants and traders pass through reasonably regularly, do they not? In which case, we'll need to provide a more detailed description when we question the locals.

Alphinaud

-- Fear not, Krile‚îÄI have already prepared several sketches of Thancred for that very purpose.

Y'shtola

-- This...this is impressive. You drew him from memory?

Alphinaud

-- A skill I acquired some years ago for reasons I no longer remember. I propose we split into two pairs. Y'shtola and I will inquire at the outlying encampments, while Luna and Krile question the residents of Tailfeather. Afterwards, we shall regroup near Loth ast Vath and share our findings.

-- Assuming there are no objections, let us be about it.

Krile

-- My, he certainly has matured, hasn't he? Hard to imagine he was once a boy who practiced drawing for hours to impress young ladies... Anyway, we had best get started. Find me when you've finished making your rounds.

Alphinaud's Sketch (Item)

-- A surprisingly accurate depiction of the missing Thancred, suggesting that Alphinaud may have mistaken his life's calling.

Loupard

-- Searchin' for a friend of yours? Let's have a look then.

-- Hmm...no, ain't seen him around. Sorry. Nobody here but us and the chocobos, friend. Maybe someone else knows your man.

Marcehamp

-- What's that you've got there? A sketch?

-- Hmm... Can't say I know the face. You say he's somethin' of a warrior? Hmm...I heard a tale the other day about a Hyuran vagabond who brought down a bandersnatch by himself‚îÄan' with style. Way they tell it, he was dancin' with the beast like it was the belle of the bleedin' ball. Sound like your man? If this friend of yours is as skilled as you say, then he's sure to have found a way to survive. Still, if he's out there on his own, it's only a matter of time before he runs afoul of somethin' he can't handle.

Krile

-- Pray excuse me, but have you seen this man before?

Grimold

-- A Hyuran man? We're not exactly rare, you know. Could you be more specific?

-- ...I did spy this one bloke a while back. Didn't get a good look at his face, but it could have been him. This was beyond the forest, as I recall‚îÄalong the river, to the west of Tailfeather. I remember thinking he wasn't much of a hunter. The lad was making no effort to cover his tracks, see. That, and he was carrying an axe instead of a bow. If he was hunting chocobos, he was doing a piss-poor job of it. The birds would've smelled him coming a malm away‚îÄI know I did.

Krile

-- Finished? In that case, I think we've learned everything we can here. Let's see what the others have found out.

Alphinaud

-- I believe we are on the right track. Many of the hunters claim to have seen a strange man who could have been Thancred.

Y'shtola

-- 'Tis little wonder so many here have taken up hunting. The forest is teeming with wildlife.

Krile

-- We were to meet here, were we not?

Alphinaud

-- My apologies for our late arrival. We thought it wise to question as many hunters as we could.

Y'shtola

-- Many have made camp in inaccessible locations‚îÄideal for hunting game, not so receiving visitors.

Alphinaud

-- Nevertheless, our time proved well spent. There have been countless sightings of an exceptionally capable Hyuran hunter with whom no one is familiar. Though none chanced to see the man's face, his height and build match Thancred's description, as does his fighting prowess.

-- ...So you have heard the same tales. Be that as it may, we yet want for conclusive proof...

Krile

-- Mayhap this is unrelated, but I heard a curious tale regarding a Vath trader. He came to Tailfeather in search of garments fit for a ‚Äúman of refinement‚Äù‚îÄwhich seemed a rather curious description for one of his kind.

Y'shtola

-- ...You are implying that Thancred sent a Vath to market in his stead? Why would he not go himself?

Alphinaud

-- Well, if you recall, you yourself emerged from the Lifestream as naked as your nameday. It is a scene I shall never forget‚îÄ

Y'shtola

-- Is it now?

Alphinaud

-- Well, I was pleased to see you! I-I mean‚îÄ It was a simple statement of fact! It stands to reason that Thancred found himself in the same...predicament.

Krile

-- In any case, if he had dealings with the Vath, they should be able to tell us, no?

Alphinaud

-- Quite right, Krile, quite right...

Y'shtola

-- Given that Alphinaud seems to recall the details of my return so vividly, I would rather he did not draw me from memory, talented or not.

Krile

-- Honestly, that boy... Some things never change.

It would seem that Krile has heard a great many stories about Master Matoya‚îÄsome less than flattering. Never one to offer empty words of comfort, Y'shtola states that all the rumors are true, before steering Krile into the hermit's abode. Follow and hope that the legendary scholar is in an agreeable mood.

While conversing with Matoya, Krile reveals not only that she possesses the Echo, but that she has availed herself of the blessing of Light's protection, finally solving the mystery of her preservation during the attack on the Isle of Val. She further explains that with the aid of Matoya's Crystal Eye, she can use her unique manifestation of the Echo to locate and trace the lingering aetheric essence of Thancred. Having taken a liking to the girl, Matoya consents to Krile's plan, which the young scholar wastes no time carrying out. In a trance, she declares that Thancred emerged from the Lifestream near the base of Sohm Al‚îÄa wilderness which the hunters of Tailfeather know only too well. Begin your search for the bard there.

To aid in questioning the locals, Alphinaud distributes several surprisingly accurate sketches of Thancred, which he apparently drew from memory‚îÄa skill he developed for reasons he claims to have forgotten, though Krile clearly has not. With sketch in hand, question the hunters of Tailfeather.

Several of the locals make mention of a heretofore unknown hunter, though none managed to get a clear look at the man's face. Less encouragingly, one states that the hunter wielded an axe, which is hardly Thancred's weapon of choice. Inform Krile that you have completed your inquiries.

Krile, too, has finished making inquiries, and is eager to hear what the others have learned. Accompany her to the rendezvous point east of Loth ast Vath and wait for Alphinaud and Y'shtola.

Like you, Alphinaud and Y'shtola both heard tell of a mysterious Hyuran hunter, whose build and fighting prowess seem reminiscent of Thancred. Krile, however, has a different tale to share‚îÄone of a Vath trader who came to Tailfeather in search of garments fit for a ‚Äúman of refinement.‚Äù The account prompts Y'shtola to question why Thancred would send a Vath in his stead, in response to which Alphinaud loudly recalls how she was naked as her nameday when she returned from the Lifestream. Krile quickly interjects that your next course of action should be to question the Vath, sparing Alphinaud Y'shtola's scorn...for a time.
